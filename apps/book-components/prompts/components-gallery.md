Implement a components gallery.

- The gallery of these components should be in `/`.
- Each component should have its own folder in the project, and adding and removing them should be easy.
- Each component should have a profile page accessible from the `/`.
- On the component's profile page, there should be a preview of the component itself, as well as its technical parameters and a link to the repository for developers, where they can copy the component.
- The component should be self-contained in its folder, and someone should be able to copy the folder to use the component.
- The page and components are designed with Tailwind.
- Create two mock components:
        1) Textarea with word counting
        2) Mermaid graph showing a social graph
- The purpose of this repository is to showcase Promptbook React components for developers.
- The things that exist in this project are now just boilerplate. Remove the boilerplate code by this assignment.
- Implement everything the next project should have, such as a title and meta tags,...
