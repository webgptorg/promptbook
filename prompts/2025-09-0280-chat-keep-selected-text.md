[笨ｨ洶云 When the `Chat` component is updated, do not remove text selection if the user selecting a text range

-   By update I mean when new message is added or existing message is changed
-   This should work in all browsers and OS-es
-   This is especially important for `MockedChat` where messages are updated rapidly, user trying to select text and copy some text in the middle of the chat history and its frustrating when the selection is constantly removed
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`
