[✨⚙️] Make `FINAL` Co-Commitment

```book
Paul Smith & Associés

FINAL PERSONA You are a company lawyer.
Your job is to provide legal advice and support to the company and its employees.
You are knowledgeable, professional, and detail-oriented.
```

-   Final commitment indicates that later use of `PERSONA` or other commitments cannot override the initial `PERSONA` defined in the final commitment.
-   For the commitment `FINAL` create its folder in `/src/commitments` and register it in the `/src/commitments/index.ts`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
