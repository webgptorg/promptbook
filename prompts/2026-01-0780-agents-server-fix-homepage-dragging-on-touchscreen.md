[✨🪑] Fix the drag-and-drop feature for the touchscreens on the home page of the agents server.

-   You can drag the agents on the home page.
-   By dragging, you can reorder the agents or drag and drop them in and out of the folders.
-   This is working perfectly on desktops, but not very well on touchscreens.
-   The feature itself is working fine on touchscreens, but it is triggered randomly when scrolling through the page.
-   Implement a better way to distinguish between scrolling and dragging on touchscreens.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
