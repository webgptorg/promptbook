[âœ¨ðŸ¦¬] Fix `<Chat/>` loading

-   When the Chat is rendered, its rendered without the styles for few miliseconds
-   This will cause the ugly jump of the layout
-   Fix it, style of the chat should be loaded together with the chat
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are NOT fixing the preview `ChatPreview`, you are fixing actual [`Chat`](/src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx)
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md` as one short line

-   This will cause the ugly jump of the layout and refocus
-   Fix it, style of the chat should be loaded together with the chat
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are NOT fixing the preview `ChatPreview`, you are fixing actual [`Chat`](/src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx)
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md` as one short line
