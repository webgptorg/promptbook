[✨🕌] Generate boilerplate rules and personas in the language of the server.

-   Agent-server can generate agent names from multiple language pools.
    -   For example, it can generate names like "John Doe" or "Jiří Novák" based on the server settings in metadata.
-   When generating boilerplate for new agents, generate also initial rules and personas in the same language as the agent name.
-   Look at /src/utils/random/$generateBookBoilerplate.ts
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
