[✨🦌] Enhance visually the context menu when there is a small screen.

-   Currently, when the screen is small, the context menu just overflows outside of the screen, which makes it impossible to click on the some items
-   We should make it responsive and make sure that the context menu is always fully visible on the screen, even on smaller screens.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
