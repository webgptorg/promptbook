[✨♠️] `COLOR` and `FONT` coomitments should be separatable both by "," and " "

**All of theese should work the same:**

```book
COLOR red, blue, green
COLOR red blue green
FONT Arial, sans-serif
FONT Arial sans-serif
```

-   Not only "," work as separator
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
