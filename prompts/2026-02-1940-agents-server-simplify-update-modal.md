[✨🎦] Enhance the new version modal

-   There is a modal which tells the user that there is a new version of the application deployed and that the user should refresh the page
-   Simplify this modal
-   Add there a countdown which will start when the user is focused
-   User can stop the countdown.
-   If the user doesn't stop the countdown, the page will be refreshed after 7 seconds of being focused, so the user will get the new version without refreshing manually.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
