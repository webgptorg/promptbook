[.] _<- TODO: [🥀] Study how the sourcing is working_

[✨🧮] For some reason, the agent (GPT assistant) is sometimes showing the name of the document, but sometimes it is showing just "source".

-   @@@
-   Sometimes it shows "【5:1†source】" instead of "@@@"
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
