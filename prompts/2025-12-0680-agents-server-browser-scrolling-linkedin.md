[✨😩] Create test function that will scroll the LinkedIn

-   On page `/admin/browser-test` there is a testing suite for browser automation
-   Now there is a suite for testing Facebook
-   Add a third button "Act on LinkedIn" that will:
    -   Opens the LinkedIn
    -   Wait for the page to load
    -   wait for the user to be logged in _(check for presence of profile avatar or other element that indicates user is logged in)_
    -   Act on page similarly as the Facebook one
    -   Project the browser view on the page so the user can see the scrolling in action
        -   Note: Now the browser is not headless, so you can see both the projected view and the actual browser window but in the future the browser might be headless so the projected view is the only way to see what is happening
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, reuse any existing code, logic, prompts,... where possible, create abstractions if needed.
