[âœ¨ðŸª¢] `<Chat>` component should support markdown and html tables

-   When the message content contains markdown or html tables, there should be rendered as tables not as plain text with "---" and "|"
-   Chat component is in /src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`
