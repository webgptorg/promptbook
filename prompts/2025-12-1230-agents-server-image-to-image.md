[x] !!!

[✨⏸] Allow to add image in the image prompt.

-   You are working with entire vertical from object representing the prompt to the agent server.
-   This is similar to chat file attachments. Look how they are implemented.
-   It should work in the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server` in http://localhost:4440/admin/image-generator-test
-   In `/admin/image-generator-test` add ability to add image in the image prompt.
-   Use the existing image upload component and CDN if needed
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
