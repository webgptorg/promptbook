[✨☘️] Allow agent to send emails using `USE EMAIL` commitment

-   Agent server already supports email queue. Use it.
-   Allow to add optional additional instructions after use mail commitment. For example: `USE EMAIL Write always formal and polite emails, always greet.`
    -   Take inspiration from `USE TIME` / `USE SEARCH ENGINE` how additional instructions are implemented.
-   When the agent uses the email tool, show the corresponding chiplet (similar to `USE TIME` and `USE SEARCH ENGINE`), the chiplet will open pop-up with the email content and metadata (to, from, subject, etc). The chiplet should have nice email icon with the email subject as title and pop-up should show full email content in some non-editable email-like layout. (take inspiration from Gmail UI)
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
