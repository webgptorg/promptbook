[✨🏃] Allow to pause `MockedChat`

-   Add prop `isPausable?: boolean;` into `MockedChatProps`
-   When pausable, show a "Pause" button alongside the "New chat" button
-   When pause pressed, change the state to "Pausing" and finish the current message, then stop showing new messages until "Resume" button is pressed
-   By default, `isPausable` should be `true`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`
