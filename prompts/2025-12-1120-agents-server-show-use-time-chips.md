[✨♕] When the `USE TIME` is used, show the chiplet which will show that time was used.

-   Make it similar to `USE SEARCH ENGINE` chiplet,
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
