[笨ｨ洫云 Allow to expose agent as OpenRouter compatible MCP server running on http(s)

-   Agent has URL like `/agents/[agentName]`
-   There should be new endpoint `/agents/[agentName]/api/mcp` that exposes the Promptbook agent as MCP compatible API endpoint
-   Implement the MCP API specification for chat completions
-   Use tokens for authentication from the `ApiTokens` table and corresponding token middleware
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
