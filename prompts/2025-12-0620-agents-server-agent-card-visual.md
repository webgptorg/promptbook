[✨🦕] <AgentCard/> should look better

-   In Agents Server application, in the agents list `/agents` and in the main page `/`, the agent cards use the `<AgentCard/>` component
-   The cards look very basic and boring
-   In the other hand, the agent profile on `/agents/[agentName]` page looks way better _(see screenshot)_
-   Update the `<AgentCard/>` component to look more like small version of the agent profile page
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.

Make it more compact - the image should be on the left side of the card and name on the right, use just the grained background not double bg

-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
