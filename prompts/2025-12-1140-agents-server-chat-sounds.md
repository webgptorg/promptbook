[✨⬇️] Add chat sounds

-   Add sound effects to the chat component for better user experience.
-   The sounds should be gentle and not annoying.
-   Use the following sounds:
    -   A soft "ding" sound when a new message is received from the agent.
    -   A subtle "whoosh" sound when the user sends a message.
    -   A light "tap" sound when the user clicks on buttons within the chat.
    -   Typing indicator sound when the agent is "Thinking..." the response.
-   Ensure the sounds are not too loud and can be muted by the user.
-   Add an option in the chat settings to enable/disable sounds in the menu saved in local storage.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   You are working with the [<Chat/>](./src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx) component.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](./changelog/_current-preversion.md)
