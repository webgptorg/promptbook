[✨🏰] Make system for commitment modifiers, the "co-commitments"

```book
Paul Smith & Associés

PERSONA You are a company lawyer.
Your job is to provide legal advice and support to the company and its employees.
IMPORTANT RULE You are knowledgeable, professional, and detail-oriented.
```

-   In this example, the `RULE` is the commitment which is being modified by the `IMPORTANT` co-commitment.
-   Co-commitments modify the behavior of the main commitment they are attached to.
-   Co-commitments can be stacked, e.g., `FINAL IMPORTANT RULE ...`
-   Co-commitments affect only the commitment they are attached to and do not influence other commitments in the prompt.
-   For the commitments create its folder in `/src/commitments` and register it in the `/src/commitments/index.ts`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
