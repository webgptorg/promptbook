[✨🌕] From `@promptbook/components` export component `<PromptbookAgent agentUrl="http://s6.ptbk.io/benjamin-white" />`

-   When this component is used, it should render the floating agent button with ability to open the chat window
-   Take the floating agent logic from `C:\Users\me\work\webgptorg\promptbook-studio\src\pages\api\embed\miniapp.js.ts`
-   You can use this component to create Agent on one Promptbook Agents server and embed it on another website
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
