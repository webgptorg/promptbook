[✨🫕] Enhance UI of agent page on mobile

-   PC version of agent page `/agents/[agentName]` has nice layout on desktop but not on mobile
-   Improve the UI of agent page on mobile devices to be more user-friendly and visually appealing
-   The PC version should remain unchanged
-   Agent page should show profile of the agent without needing to scroll
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
