[✨🧬] When creating new agent, show the floating hint

-   Ensure that the floating hint looks great on both desktop and mobile.
-   The hint should be hidden at the time when the user drags or drops the file there, or just writes anything to the book editor.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
