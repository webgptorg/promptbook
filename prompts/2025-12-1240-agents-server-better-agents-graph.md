[✨♿️] Agents graph on home page should be redesigned using d3.js library

-   Keep in mind UI and UX best practices for graph visualization.
-   Implement interactive features such as zooming, panning, and node highlighting on hover.
-   Ensure the graph is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
-   Keep in mind that all features of the current graph should be preserved, such as
    -   Displaying agent image with name
    -   Working both with default and explicit agent images
    -   Working with current agent server and federated servers
    -   Grouping agents by server
    -   Displaying relationships between agents
    -   Filtering
    -   All other existing features
-   Cleanup the unused code related to the old graph implementation.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
