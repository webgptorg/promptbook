[✨🧁] Create components `AgentProfile` and `AgentProfileFromSource`

-   `AgentProfile` shows agent's profile
-   Agent profile look like profile on Agents Server `/agents/[agentName]` page
-   Use `/agents/[agentName]` in `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server` to keep DRY principle
-   `AgentProfileFromSource` is internally using `AgentProfile` and takes `agentSource: string_book` prop
-   Take inspiration from `AvatarChip` and `AvatarChipFromSource`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
