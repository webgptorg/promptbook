-   Create commitment `INITIAL MESSAGE` in the book
-   The content of this initial message should be shown as the first message in the `<AgentChat />`
-   It should work for example in the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
