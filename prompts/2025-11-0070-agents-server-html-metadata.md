[✨💟] Agent pages should contain proper HTML metadata

-   By metadata we mean at `<title>`, `<meta name="description" content="...">`, and Open Graph / Twitter Card tags
-   The metadata should be based on the agent's name and description stored in Promptbook
-   The metadata should be set for `/agents/[agentName]` and `/agents/[agentName]/chat` pages
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
