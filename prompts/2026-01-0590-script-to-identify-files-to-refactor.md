[✨🐮] Create a script that will go through the repository and detect the files which are too large. Put there some thresholds, for example 500 lines and go only through the source codes. For example TypeScript files, text files and so on allow to specify the VMK, but because exceptions, because for example spellcheck text files shouldn't be under the rules of maximal number of lines in the project. The purpose of the script is to identify the places which should be refactored, also detect more than four entities in the file. By entity, I mean for example function, class, type, interface and so on. And if there are more than four entities in the file, the file should also be flagged. All of these constants like 500 or four and so on should be in some file constants alongside this identifying script. You are not doing the refactoring itself, you are just marking the files which will be refactored after that in different process. You could create a script under the scripts folder in the repository and also register a script in terminals JSON invest code folder. When you flag or identify the files which should be refactored, create for each refactoring separate prompt and put it into the prompts directory and preserve the structure in which the prompts are placed there. Recycle to logic or make some obstruction to keep drive principle with the generate prompt script to not repeat the code. And for each flagged file there should be created one markdown file with one prompt. And there should be some template which says like refactor this file and blah blah blah. I will write it manually after this and note or be aware that you are not doing the refactoring itself. You are just doing script that will create prompts that will be then run by totally different process and these files with these prompts will be doing the refactoring work. You are only doing the preparation for this work.
