[✨🌥] Enhance the UX of the left panel drawer with the chats.

-   Clicking outside of the panel should close the panel
-   Opening and closing of the panel should have some nice animation.
-   Panel shouldn't be cropped by the menu _(See the screenshot I have given you)_
-   On mobile, remove the unnecessary second top bar and move it to the left side of the screen small icon ">" in the middle of the leftmost side of the viewport
-   On desktop there should be a minimal full-height panel on the left side of the screen
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
