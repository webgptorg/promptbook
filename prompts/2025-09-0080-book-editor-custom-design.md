[✨😏] Implement `<BookEditor isBorderRadiusDisabled />`

-   Add `isBorderRadiusDisabled?: boolean` prop to `<BookEditor>` component.
-   When `isBorderRadiusDisabled` is `true`, the `<BookEditor>` component should have sharp corners (no border radius).
-   This is the internal shadow dom border which is currently rounded.
-   By default, the `<BookEditor>` component has rounded corners (current state) and `isBorderRadiusDisabled` is by default `false`.
