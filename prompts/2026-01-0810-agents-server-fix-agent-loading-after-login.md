[✨🪄] Agents are not loaded after login but only after refreshing the page

-   When you log in to the agent server, the agents are not loaded until you refresh the page. Please fix this issue so that the agents are loaded immediately after login without needing to refresh.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
