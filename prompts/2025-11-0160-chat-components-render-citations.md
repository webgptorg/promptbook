[✨🚸] Render text citations

-   Citation looks like "【4:0†source】"
-   The citations are already implemented in `C:/Users/me/work/webgptorg/promptbook-studio/src/components/Content/extensions/sourceCitationExtension.ts`, take a look how they are implemented there
-   Implement the citation rendering into [Chat component](/src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
