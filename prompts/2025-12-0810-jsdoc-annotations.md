[✨🏗] Do fulltext search of "@@@" across the repository and write text and annotations there

-   The "@@@" is used as placeholder for some text that need to be filled
-   It is used as placeholder for JSDoc annotations that need to be added into codebase
-   Search for all occurences of "@@@" in the repository
