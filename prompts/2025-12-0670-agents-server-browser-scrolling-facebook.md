[✨😋] Create test function that will scroll the Facebook

-   On page `/admin/browser-test` there is a testing suite for browser automation
-   For now there is one button that screenshots the `https://ptbk.io` homepage
-   Add a second button "Scroll Facebook" that will:
    -   Open `https://www.facebook.com/`
    -   Wait for the page to load
    -   wait for the user to be logged in _(check for presence of profile avatar or other element that indicates user is logged in)_
    -   Scroll down the page indefinitely, loading more content
    -   Project the browser view on the page so the user can see the scrolling in action
        -   Note: Now the browser is not headless, so you can see both the projected view and the actual browser window but in the future the browser might be headless so the projected view is the only way to see what is happening
-   This should be the second button on the page, next to the existing "Take Screenshot" button
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, reuse any existing code where possible, create abstractions if needed.
