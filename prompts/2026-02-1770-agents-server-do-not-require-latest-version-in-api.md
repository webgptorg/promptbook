[✨💍] Do not require the latest version of the client in the API or compatibility modes.

-   There is a mechanism on the agent server that enforces the latest version of the client.
-   This is good for the frontend, but it shouldn't be in the API or in the OpenAI or OpenRouter compatibility modes.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of requiring the latest version and the compatibility modes before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
