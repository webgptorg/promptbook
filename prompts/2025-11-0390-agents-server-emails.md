[!] _<- Note: Do it afrer [✨🦄] Message object and table is done_

[✨🚃] Create system for sending and receiving emails

-   There should be ability to send and receive emails for agents
-   Make plugin structure for that, see how for example LLM providers or scrapers are structured
-   Bring the logic from [WebGPT app](C:/Users/me/work/webgpt/webgpt-app/scripts/send-emails)
-   Look on table `Message`, there should be place for inbound messages and queue for outbound messages
-   Create table `MessageSendAttempt` that will store each attempt to send the message
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
