[✨🎶] On the home page of the agent server, you can accidentaly click out of the modal or click on the closing button and loose the written agent book.

-   This is a very bad UX and can be easily prevented by asking the user for confirmation before closing the modal if there are unsaved changes in the agent book.
-   Also leverage the prevetion of closing the browser tab if there are unsaved changes in the agent book.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, create some good designed system for this closing prevention which can be shared across the agent server application.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
