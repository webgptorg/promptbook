[✨💠] Enhance the text-to-speech feature.

-   The text to speech feature is not very sensitive for the ending of the speech. It took a long time to be ended.
-   There is not a very good indication what is going on. Indicate it in some floating speech bubble.
-   After the speaking, the microphone is still used on the background. - This is causing problems for example in the mobile phones where you don't get freed the microphone resource and the audio which is playing from another app is playing in a lower quality than it should.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of text to speech before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server) with the agent chat.
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
