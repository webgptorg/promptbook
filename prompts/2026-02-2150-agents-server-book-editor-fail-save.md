[✨↕️] Enhance the UX when the `BookEditor` fails to save.

-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Prevent leaving the page before the client is sure that the book was saved successfully on the server.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
