[✨🧞] Allow to upload documents from phone

-   When seeing agent source as book in `/agents/[agentName]/book` or `/agents/[agentName]/book+chat` you can drag and drop documents to upload them
-   But on mobile phones its not possible to drag and drop files
-   Add button "Upload document" that opens file picker to select documents to upload
-   This should be in the <BookEditor /> menu
-   This button should be visible both on desktop and mobile
-   Add prop `isUploadButtonShown` to <BookEditor /> component to control visibility of this button, it should default to `true`
-   Also add button "Take photo" that opens camera to take photo and upload it as document
-   Add prop `isCameraButtonShown` to <BookEditor /> component to control visibility of this button, it should default to `true` on mobile devices and `false` on desktop devices
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
