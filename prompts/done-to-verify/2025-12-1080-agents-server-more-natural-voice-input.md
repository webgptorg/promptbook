[✨⛹️] In the <Chat/> component, make voice input more natural

-   Voice input now is extremely unfriendly. You need to manually start and stop the recording, and after stop of the recording, it can take up to a minute for anything to happen.
-   Improve the voice input in the chat component to be more natural, for example:
    -   When user clicks on the microphone button, start recording audio.
    -   When user stops speaking for more than 2 seconds, automatically stop recording and send the audio for transcription.
    -   Show some visual feedback that the audio is being processed.
    -   Once transcription is done, automatically insert the transcribed text into the chat input box.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
