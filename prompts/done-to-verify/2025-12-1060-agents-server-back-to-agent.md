[✨🌪] All of the agent pages should have a button "Back to Agent"

-   Each agent has multiple pages associated with this agent. http://localhost:4440/agents/GMw67JN8TXxN7y/...
    -   The "GMw67JN8TXxN7y" is some agent id.
-   Look for example at [System Message page](http://localhost:4440/agents/GMw67JN8TXxN7y/system-message) which has this button This we want; take it as inspiration.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
