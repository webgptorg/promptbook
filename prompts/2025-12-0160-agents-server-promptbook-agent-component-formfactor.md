[✨👔] Add prop `formfactor` to `PromptbookAgent` component

**Example:**

```typescript
<PromptbookAgent formfactor="seamless" /> // Default, current behavior
<PromptbookAgent formfactor="book" /> // Show the Agent as a book in BookEditor
<PromptbookAgent formfactor="chat" /> // Show the Agent as a chat which is not floating but as AgentChat component
<PromptbookAgent formfactor="profile" /> // Show the Agent as a profile using AgentProfile component
```
