[✨⬅️] When you are inheriting one agent from another via `FROM`, you are not inheriting the description and the profile picture and other `META`, fix it.

-   You should inherit all the `META` and `INITIAL MESSAGE`.
-   You can for sure overwrite this in the child agent, but by default it should be inherited.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality How agents work and inheritance (`FROM` commitment, `Adam` agent) work before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
