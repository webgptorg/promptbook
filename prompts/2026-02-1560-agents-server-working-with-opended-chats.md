[✨🧦] Allow to chat both with the opened and closed left panel with your chats.

-   Now, when this panel is opened, the chat area is inactive and the user cannot chat. The user can click on this area and the left panel is automatically closed.
-   But ideally, we want to chat both in the open state and closed state of this panel.
-   This is relevant only for desktop. The mobile behavior should remain the same as it is now.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
