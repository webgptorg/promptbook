[笨ｨ洫余 In the desktop, allow to drag agents (and folders) on a home page to reorder / put into the folders by their entire area, not only the drag handle.

-   Also hide the drag handles.
-   This is relevant only for desktop. For the mobile and touch screens, keep the current behavior.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.

-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
