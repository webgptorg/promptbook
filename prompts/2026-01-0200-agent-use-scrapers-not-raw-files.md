[!!!!!]

[✨🥚] When the agent creates its underlying GPT assistant, the knowledge files are uploaded 1:1 to the OpenAI. Change the logic such as convert the files via scrapers which are already existing in this project and upload just Markdown to OpenAI.

-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](./changelog/_current-preversion.md)
