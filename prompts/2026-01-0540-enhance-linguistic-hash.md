[✨📸] There is a function to do the linguistic hash, enhance it

-   Now it spits just three words like "Slick sigh beating" or "Slick sigh beating", Change it in a such way that the linguistic hash will be entire sentence "story" and much more memorable.
-   There is both the function which can be used from the package and the showcase page and also unit test. Look at entire vertical of it.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Utils app](apps/utils) on page http://localhost:4024/linguistic-hash
