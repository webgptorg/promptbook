[✨🔽] /deep-planning Implement better logging practices

-   When running Promptbook in docker container, allow to turn on/off logging based on single environment variable which should be propagated to all services.
-   Use a consistent logging format across all services.
-   Ensure that logs are structured and can be easily parsed.
-   Make `logger` a single instance
-   Add a log level configuration to control verbosity.
-   Use `logger` instead of `console` in all places (do not use it in playground and servicing scripts, just in Promptbook engine)
