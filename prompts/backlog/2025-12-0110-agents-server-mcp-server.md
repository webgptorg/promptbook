[✨⛑] Create MCP server for Agents Server

-   Do not be confused by MCP server of each agent, there are 3 separate things:
    -   Exposing an agent as MCP server
    -   Each agent being able to connect to external MCP servers
    -   Managing the entire instance of Promptbook Agents Server via MCP server _(this is done in this task)_
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
