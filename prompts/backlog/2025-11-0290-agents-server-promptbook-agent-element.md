[✨🧿] Create `<promptbook-agent agent-url="http://s6.ptbk.io/benjamin-white" />` element

-   `promptbook-agent` is custom html element based on the `PromptbookAgent` React component exposed via `@promptbook/components` package
-   Create script that will define the custom element and register it globally
-   The script should be able to be included via simple `<script src="..."></script>` tag
-   It will have on Agents Server URL `/api/embed.js`
-   Than anywhere on the web, user can include this script and use the `<promptbook-agent />` element to embed the agent chat widget
-   This is just wrapper around the existing `PromptbookAgent` component
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
