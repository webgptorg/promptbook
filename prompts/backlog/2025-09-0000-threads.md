[✨🗯] Implement chat threads in [`LlmExecutionTools`](/src/execution/LlmExecutionTools.ts)

-   Implement as smoothly as possible the threads for chat completions in the `LlmExecutionTools` class
-   Do not create any new methods, just modify the type `ChatPrompt` _(look on code snippet below)_
-   Do implementation for each `LlmExecutionTools` and also for every part of the system that works with `LlmExecutionTools`
-   In places marked by "[🗯]" are references to the new thread functionality
-   Use it in `LlmChat` component
-   Keep in mind DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

```typescript
export type ChatPrompt = CommonPrompt & {
    /**
     * Requirements for chat model
     */
    modelRequirements: ChatModelRequirements;

    /**
     *
     */
    previousMessage: ChatMessage | null;

    // <- TODO: !!
};
```
