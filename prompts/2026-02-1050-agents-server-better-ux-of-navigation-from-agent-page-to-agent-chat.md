[✨🩰] The UX of navigation from the agent profile page to the agent chat page.

-   Now the navigation is clunky and feels bad
-   When a user writes a message in the profile page, it opens the chat page with this message pre-filled.
-   It feels just like normal navigation between two pages, not a coherent app.
-   The page transition is:
    1.  Agent profile page - http://localhost:4440/agents/RLcP3snv2ifR3H
    2.  Agent chat page - http://localhost:4440/agents/RLcP3snv2ifR3H/chat
-   The entire feeling and UX of the situation should feel like one seamless application.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
