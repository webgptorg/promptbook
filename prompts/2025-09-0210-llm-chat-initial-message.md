[✨🚹] Add `readonly initialMessages?: ReadonlyArray<ChatMessage>;` into `LlmChatProps`

-   This will allow to set initial messages into the `LlmChat`
-   It should work both for initial message from user and from AI assistant
-   Use this in `LlmChatPreview` in all the scenarios, create some unique (and funny and unusual) initial messages for each scenario
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`
