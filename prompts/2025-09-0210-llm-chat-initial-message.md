[âœ¨ðŸš¹] Add `readonly initialMessages?: ReadonlyArray<ChatMessage>;` into `LlmChatProps`

-   This will allow to set initial messages into the `LlmChat`
-   It should work both for initial message from user and from AI assistant
-   Use this in `LlmChatPreview` in all the scenarios, create some unique (and funny and unusual) initial messages for each scenario
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`

[âœ¨ðŸš¹] The `initialMessages` should be used not only on the first chat but also after resetting via "New chat" button
