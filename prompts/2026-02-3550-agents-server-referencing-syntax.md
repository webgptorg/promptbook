-   All of the above ways of referencing agents `{a}`, `{a a}`, `@b`, `https://example.com/c`, `{https://example.com/d}` should work and be highlighted in the same way in the book editor, they are the same syntax feature just different notation
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
