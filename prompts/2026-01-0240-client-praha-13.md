[✨🤳] Enhance the error messages when something fails when chatting with agents in agent server.

-   When something fails when chatting with agents in agent server, the error messages are not very user friendly.
-   Improve the error messages to be more descriptive and user friendly.
-   The raw error message should be logged via `console.error`, but the user should see a more friendly message.
-   Add retry button to the error message popup to allow the user to retry the last message if something fails.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`

[✨🤳] Translate the OpenAI Assistant GPT sources to the Promptbook native chips.

-   Now ugly chips like 【5:13†document.pdf】 are shown in the chat when the agent uses RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to answer the user question.
-   Translate these ugly chips to the Promptbook native chips like ones used in `USE SEARCH ENGINE` commitment.
-   When you click on the source chip. It should show a pop-up with the preview of the source document.

-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
