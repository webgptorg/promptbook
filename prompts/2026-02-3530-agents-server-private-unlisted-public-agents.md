[✨👁] Allow agents to be private, public or unlisted

-   The visibility of the agent is set outside of the agent source, the visibility can be set in the agent context menu or in batch on entire folders. The visibility can be `PRIVATE`, `UNLISTED`, or `PUBLIC`.
-   Make metadata item `DEFAULT_VISIBILITY` for agents in the agent book, which can be set to `PRIVATE`, `UNLISTED`, or `PUBLIC`. When creating a new agent, it will have this default visibility, by default use `UNLISTED`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
