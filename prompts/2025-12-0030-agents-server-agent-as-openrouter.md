[笨ｨ洟余 Allow to expose agent as OpenRouter compatible API

-   Agent has URL like `/agents/[agentName]`
-   There should be new endpoint `/agents/[agentName]/api/openrouter` that exposes the Promptbook agent as OpenRouter compatible API
-   Implement the OpenRouter API specification for chat completions
-   Use tokens for authentication from the `ApiTokens` table and corresponding token middleware
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
