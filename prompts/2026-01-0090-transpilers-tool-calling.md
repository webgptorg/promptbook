[✨🕯] Implement tool calling when transpiling book into the code.

-   Bring all the function implementations which are used in the Transpiler agent.
-   For example, if the agent is using `USE TIME` commitment, the transpiled code should include the implementation of the `get_current_time` which is used to get the current time.
-   Orchestrate the tool call and the second call to the AI model - the Transpiled code should work as a standalone chatbot which can be run without any need of understanding how tool calling works under the hood.
-   Look at [/src/transpilers/openai-sdk/OpenAiSdkTranspiler.ts](OpenAiSdkTranspiler.ts)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
