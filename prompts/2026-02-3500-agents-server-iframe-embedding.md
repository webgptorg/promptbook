[✨✂️] Ensure that embedding of agents in iframes is propperly allowed or disallowed based on a new `IS_EMBEDDING_ALLOWED` metadata item.

-   Add a new metadata item `IS_EMBEDDING_ALLOWED` for agents server, which can be set to `true` or `false`. By default, it should be `true`
-   When `IS_EMBEDDING_ALLOWED` is `true`, allow embedding the agent in iframes by setting appropriate headers. When `IS_EMBEDDING_ALLOWED` is `false`, disallow embedding the agent in iframes by setting appropriate headers.
-   When allowed, add embedding sample into the agent integrations page, showing how to embed an agent in an iframe - code and sample
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
