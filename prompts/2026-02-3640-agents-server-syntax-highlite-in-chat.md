[✨𓀖] In the chat use the monaco editor for the code snippets

-   Now, when there is a code snippet in the chat markdown, it is shown in a simple black box with white text without any syntax highlighting.
-   Be aware that there can be multiple code snippets with multiple languages. Isolate these Monaco editors to not interfere with one syntax highlighting with other syntax highlighting.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server) with the <Chat/> component and the markdown rendering inside it.
    -   This should be a feature of the markdown rendering on the entire agent server, not only for the chat.
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
