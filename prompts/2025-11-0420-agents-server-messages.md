```
@@@@
id: number;
createdAt: string;
updatedAt: string;
channel: string;
direction: string;
sender: Json;
recipient: Json;

```

-   Purpose of this is to prepare for future where we can have messages from different sources, not only chat messages in web chat
-   It should be ready for both inbound and outbound messages
-   It should be ready for web messages, email messages, sms, Whatsapp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.
-   For this create the database table `Message`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
