[✨😱] Store the chat history for non-logged user

-   For each anonymous user, create some ad-hoc username which will be stored in the localstorage or cookies.
-   Store my chats in same way as for the logged users, but connected with this anonymous username.
-   This anonymous usernames should start with `anonymous-` prefix to distinguish them from the real users in the database.
-   Use the same function to generate the rest of the ID as the ID of the agents or chats.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)

### Memories vs. self-learning in Agents server

There are two similar concepts you should know and shouldn't confuse you:

-   **Self-learning** Is a capability of an agent to self-edit their source book and append new commitments.
-   **Memories** Is a capability of an agent to store some information snippets in the database connected with the user.
