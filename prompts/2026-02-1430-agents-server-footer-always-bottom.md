[✨🌙] When the page is being loaded, The footer should be always snapped On the bottom of the screen.

-   Currently, when the page is being loaded, the footer is somewhere in the middle of the screen because content is not long enough, and it looks really bad. The footer should be always snapped on the bottom of the screen, even when the content is not long enough to fill the screen.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
