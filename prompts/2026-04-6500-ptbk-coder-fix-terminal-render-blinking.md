[✨🐳] Fix blinking `ptbk coder run`

```bash
ptbk coder run --agent github-copilot --model gpt-5.4 --thinking-level xhigh --context AGENTS.md
```

-   This renders nice terminal UI, but it blinks and flickers a lot, which is very annoying and makes it hard to use, especially for long-running agents that produce a lot of output
-   It blinks even if nothing is changing and the script is waiting
-   There are lot of terminal apps with UI that does not suffer from this problem, so it should be possible to fix it
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of `ptbk coder` and related functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with [`ptbk coder`](src/cli/cli-commands/coder/run.ts)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](./changelog/_current-preversion.md)
