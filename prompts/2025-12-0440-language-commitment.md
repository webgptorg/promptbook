-   Language is kinda variation of `RULE` but specifically focused on the language(s) the agent should use in its responses.
-   For the commitments create its folder in `/src/commitments` and register it in the `/src/commitments/index.ts`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
