[✨✌️] Enhance the default images of agents in the agent server.

-   The images look very cold and technocratic.
-   The images should look more friendly, warm, and welcoming.
-   But not childlike, but more like a friendly and wise mentor, or a helpful assistant.
-   Should be suitable for the business. Not too playful, but still friendly and warm.
-   Change only the [prompt of the image](apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/images/default-avatar.png/getAgentDefaultAvatarPrompt.ts). Do not change the generating logic.

[✨✌️] Enhance the default images of agents in the agent server.

-   The images look very cold and technocratic.
-   The images should look more friendly, warm, and welcoming.
-   But not childlike, but more like a friendly and wise mentor, or a helpful assistant.
-   Should be suitable for the business. Not too playful, but still friendly and warm.
-   **Do not do the photorealism, do some nice animated representation of the AI agents.**
-   Avoid text in the images.
-   Bring the colors of the agent into the images.
-   Be creative and try to make the images look more unique and different from each other, so it is easier for the users to distinguish between different agents.
-   Change only the [prompt of the image](apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/images/default-avatar.png/getAgentDefaultAvatarPrompt.ts). Do not change the generating logic.
