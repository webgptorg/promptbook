[✨✌️] Enhance the default images of agents in the agent server.

-   This looks old and a bit unmodern.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)

[✨✌️] Enhance the default images of agents in the agent server.

-   The images look very cold and technocratic.
-   The images should look more friendly, warm, and welcoming.
-   But not childlike, but more like a friendly and wise mentor, or a helpful assistant.
-   Should be suitable for the business. Not too playful, but still friendly and warm.
-   Change only the [prompt of the image](apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/images/default-avatar.png/getAgentDefaultAvatarPrompt.ts). Do not change the generating logic.
