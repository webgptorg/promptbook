[✨🧻] Make commitment `USE PROJECT`

```book
AI Developer

PERSONA You are an TypeScript developer
USE PROJECT https://github.com/example/project

```

-   This will allow the agent to use the project files in the specified GitHub repository as a knowledge base, it can read the files, understand the code, and use it in its responses. It also allow to commit changes to the project files, and create pull requests with the changes. etc.
-   The authentication to GitHub should be for now done manually by the user, for example by generating a personal access token and pasting it in the agent interface when the agent is created or when the commitment is made. The token should have permissions to read and write to the repository.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
