[‚ú®üè¨] `NOTE` commitment should have `COMMENT` and `NONCE` alias

-   All of these commitments have role of code comments, with just different notation, similar to `//` and `/* */` in javascript
-   Both syntaxes are equivalent:

    ```book
    NOTE This is note that not affect the agent behavior
    ```

    ```book
    COMMENT This is some comment that not affect the agent behavior
    ```

    ```book
    NONCE This is some information that not affect the agent behavior
    ```

-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle - use same CommitmentDefinition class for both aliases, simmilar to for example existing `RULE` and `RULES` aliases
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`
