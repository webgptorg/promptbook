[✨🌤] Go through the repository and create a dictionary.

-   Create a list of important terms, concepts, and definitions related to the project.
-   Notice that there are two major versions of the Promptbook:
    -   **Pipelines** _(old version, legacy, deprecated)_ - Pipelines which have clear input and output and do multiple LLM calls during the execution of the pipeline.
    -   **Agents** - Agents which have personality, knowledge, rules,... and they are a huge abstraction above the raw models.
    -   Most of the things in the repository are common and used in both of these versions.
-   Interlink these concepts via links to other dictionary entries where applicable.
-   Each entry should include the term, a brief definition, and any relevant context or examples:

**For example:**

```markdown
# Commitment

A commitment is a special syntax element used in the Promptbook to define specific behaviors or capabilities of an AI agent. Commitments are included in the agent's source code and influence how the agent interacts with users and external systems.

\`\`\`book
John Green

PERSONA You are a friendly and knowledgeable lawyer.
RULE Always provide clear and concise legal advice.
USE BROWSER
KNOWLEDGE https://legal-database.com/
\`\`\`

In this example, the agent "John Green" has several commitments `PERSONA`, `RULE`, `USE BROWSER`, and `KNOWLEDGE`, which define its personality, behavior rules, browsing capability, and knowledge source.

## Examples

-   [`PERSONA`](./commitments/persona.md) Defines the personality traits of the agent.
-   [`USE BROWSER`](./commitments/use-browser.md) Grants the agent the ability to browse the web for information.
-   [`KNOWLEDGE`](./commitments/knowledge.md) Provides the agent with specific knowledge bases to draw from.
-   [All Commitments](./commitments/README.md)
```

-   Each term should be in its own Markdown file.
-   Be verbose. Use examples. Explain be helpful. Be structured. Be specific.
-   It should be in English, but when you will be explaining commitment `LANGUAGE`, you can use different languages.
-   Try to be concrete. Do not write terms as "AI agent" or "AI something." Figure out names like John Green, Catherine Brown, and so on. When you are mentioning the books, try writing the concrete professions like "teacher," "programmer," "lawyer," and so on.
-   You can use code blocks _(for example `book`)_ for examples.
-   You can structure the dictionary into multiple folders. For example, groups of terms can be grouped inside its own directory.
-   When you use the directories, in the top of every directory should be a `README.md` file which will summarize all the terms inside serve as the index file.
-   Put it in `/documents/dictionary/**/*.md`.
