[✨😟] For the `USE` commitments, add the instractions to system message

-   There are commitments `USE SEARCH ENGINE` or `USE TIME` which are adding tools in the model requirements.
-   Also add extra instructions into the system message. For example, for `USE TIME`, the system message should contain instructions like:
    -   "You have access to the current date and time. Use it to answer questions about the current date and time..."
    -   "When you need to know the current date or time, use the tool provided to you..."
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
