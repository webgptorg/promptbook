[✨🖋] Do not add pair of learned `USER MESSAGE` and `AGENT MESSAGE` when the response came from there

-   Before each LLM call, we check if the last user message exists in the learned conversations, and if so, we provide the corresponding agent response right away
-   After that, we again add the pair of `USER MESSAGE` and `AGENT MESSAGE` to the learned conversations, which creates duplicate entries
-   Fix this by not adding the pair again when the response came from learned conversations
-   Add it only when the response was generated by the LLM
-   You are working with [Agent](/src/llm-providers/agent/Agent.ts)
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
