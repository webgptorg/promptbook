[✨🧓] Create and use the function `textToPreviewText` and use it

-   This function should convert Markdown text to the text ready to be shown as a preview in the UI. For example, in the shortcuts for my chats.
-   This is a similar concept to a function `textToSpeechText`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
