[✨🐛] When showing `book` code in <Chat/> component, use syntax via `<BookEditor/>`

**In chat message, there can be embedded books, for example:**

```book
Jack Green

RULE Always speak in modern English.
CONTEXT You are helping users of abc.com
```

-   When showing such books in <Chat/> component, do not use monaco editor, but use <BookEditor/> component for better readability
-   Use <BookEditor/> in read-only mode for showing the code snippets
-   For other languages like python, javascript, etc. still use monaco editor with syntax highlighting
-   <Chat/> component is [located in this file](/src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
