[✨🛥] Allow to prefix Supabase database tables used in Agents Server

-   Use `process.env.SUPABASE_TABLE_PREFIX` as the prefix for all Supabase tables used in the Agents Server application
-   For example, if `SUPABASE_TABLE_PREFIX=projectx_`, the table for agents would be `projectx_Agent` instead of `Agent`
-   When `SUPABASE_TABLE_PREFIX` not set, keep the current behavior _(no prefix)_
-   It should work for example in the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
