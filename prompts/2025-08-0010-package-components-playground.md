[âœ¨ğŸ“¶] Make some testing playground for `@promptbook/components`

-   You should be able to run it in as a server which will render the components
-   Server will run on `localhost:4461`
-   Add this as script to `/.vscode/terminals.json`
-   Server should serve the components from `src/book-components`
-   As a first tested component should be `<BookEditor />`
-   Playground server script should be added to `/scripts` folder
-   Look how other playgrounds are implemented in this project
