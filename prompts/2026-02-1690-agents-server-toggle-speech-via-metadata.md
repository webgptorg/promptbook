[✨🦾] Allow to turn off globally for the server voice calling or text-to-speech, speak-to-text.

-   Create or refactor two distinct metadata keys:
    1. `IS_EXPERIMENTAL_VOICE_CALLING_ENABLED` - is voice calling enabled or not. _(by default `false`)_
    2. `IS_EXPERIMENTAL_VOICE_TTS_STT_ENABLED` - is text-to-speech and speak-to-text enabled or not. _(by default `true`)_
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server) with the chat
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
