[✨🐴] Allow to pause coding agent

-   When the coding agent script is running with `--no-wait` flag, currently, there is no way to pause it.
-   We had the option to press "p" to pause the agent, The runners cannot be paused immediately, but Pause after the current prompt is finished should work.
-   Immediately show "Pausing" with gray background and when the agent is paused, show "Paused" with white background.
-   You can always unpause by pressing "p" again.
-   This pressing of the "p" should work anytime, It should just internally change state from "PAUSED" to "RUNNING".
-   This state will be checked whenever the script has a chance to pause.
-   You are working with the [coding agent script](./scripts/run-codex-prompts/run-codex-prompts.ts)
-   For the inspiration look at `C:/Users/me/work/hejny/batch-project-editor/src/utils/forPlay.ts`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
