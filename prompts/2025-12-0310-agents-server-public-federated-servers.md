[✨💾] Allow to hide agents from federated servers for anonymous users

-   Add `SHOW_FEDERATED_SERVERS_PUBLICLY` into Metadata
-   `SHOW_FEDERATED_SERVERS_PUBLICLY` are by default `false`
-   When not showing federated agents from federated servers, do not even show the federated servers in the footer and header dropdown and do not fetch their agents
-   For authenticated users, show all agents from all federated servers as before
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
