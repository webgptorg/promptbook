[✨💧] Fix `USE BROWSER`

```
# Error fetching content from URL **URL:** https://www.pavolhejny.com/ **Error:** Can not scrape websites without filesystem tools Unable to fetch and scrape the content from this URL. Please verify the URL is correct and accessible.
```

-   @@@
-   `run_browser` tool should internally use [`playwright-cli`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli)
-   Keep in mind that `USE BROWSER` is not replacing system of scrapers @@@
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   If you need to do the database migration, do it
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
