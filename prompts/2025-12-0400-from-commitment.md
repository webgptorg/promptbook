[✨💴] Create commitment `FROM`

```book
My AI Agent

FROM https://s6.ptbk.io/benjamin-white
RULE Speak only in English.
```

<- This will inherit everything from the agent at `https://s6.ptbk.io/benjamin-white` and appends the RULE commitment to its source.

-   This commitment tells the agent that its `agentSource` is inherited from another agent.
-   It should work for example in context of the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
    -   It should work with both internal and external agents
    -   External agents are agents from federated servers
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
