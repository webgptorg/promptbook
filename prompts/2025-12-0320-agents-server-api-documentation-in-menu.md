[✨💺] Create Agents server Open API documentation using swagger 

- Add API documentation link to menu
-   Create API documentation for the Agents Server using Swagger and OpenAPI standards
-   It should be available at `/swagger` endpoint
-   In the Agents Server application, in the top menu, add a link to the API documentation
-   Do not be confused with the book documentation, there are two different things:
    -   Book documentation is the documentation of the book language `/docs` and `/api/docs/book.md`
    -   API documentation is the documentation of the Agents Server API, available at `/swagger`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
