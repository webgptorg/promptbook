[✨➿] `BookEditor` should highlight book separators - horizontal lines

-   The `---` _(or 3+ dashes)_ is the syntax
-   In the `BookEditor` show horizontal lines instead of just 3 dashes
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`

[✨➿] Separators `---` in `BookEditor` should be aligned with notebook lines

-   In the `BookEditor` the horizontal lines representing the `---` separators should be aligned with the notebook horizontal lines
-   It should look like the notebook line with `---` is thicker and darker
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
