[✨📓] When you are editing agent on the Agents server and you name it with the same name, it shouldn't fail.

-   Reference existing agents in the book by their name, for example `{John the Copywriter}`
-   When you create a new agent with the same name as an existing one, it should not cause a failure. Instead, the system should handle this gracefully,the first agent should keep its name and the new one isnt referencable by name but only by id, and the system should ensure that there are no conflicts or issues arising from having multiple agents with the same name.
-   When the name collides it should just underline the name in red in the editor and show a warning that the name is already used by another agent, but it should not prevent you from saving or using the agent.
-   This is similar type of warning as when you are referencing a non-existing agent later in the book body.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of agent referencing before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
