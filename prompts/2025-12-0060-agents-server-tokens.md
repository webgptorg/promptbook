[✨ 🉑] Implement token system in Agents server

-   When logged in as admin, there should be new menu item "API Tokens" in the header after "Users"
-   In "API Tokens" page, admin can create new tokens
-   Tokens have no expiration data, granularity or limits for now
-   Create table and database migration for that with table name `ApiTokens`
-   These tokens are now unused, but in future they will be used to authenticate API requests to agents
-   Implement corresponding token middleware to authenticate requests using these tokens to be used in future
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
