[✨⛺️] Optimize Assistants usage

-   Each Promptbook agent has underlying OpenAI Assistant
-   This assistant is created on fly from the agent's source code when user starts a chat with the agent
-   It is also updated when the agent's source code changes
-   But this process is not much optimized
-   Implement caching and reuse of assistants to avoid creating new assistant for each chat session
-   Analyze the best strategy to optimize assistants creation and reuse
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
