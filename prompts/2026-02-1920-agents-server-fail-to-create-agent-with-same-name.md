[✨♾] When you try to create an agent or folder with the already existing name, it fails and the user doesn't get any message. It just doesn't create the agent, and the UI looks stucked

-   Creating agent with same name causes 500 with no usefull message
-   Same problem happens with both agents and folders
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
