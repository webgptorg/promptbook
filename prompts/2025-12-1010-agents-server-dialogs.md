[✨⛪️] Allow to close dialogs by clicking outside of the dialog.

-   Look for example at `/apps/agents-server/src/app/AddAgentButton.tsx` but not only there, this is just an example.
-   Look across the agent server application to find all the places where the dialogs are used.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`

[✨⛪️] Remove the `isOpen` prop from dialogs.

-   When the dialog is closed, it shouldn't be rendered at all.
-   Render it conditionally instead of passing `isOpen` prop.
-   Look how it is done at `/apps/agents-server/src/app/AddAgentButton.tsx`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
