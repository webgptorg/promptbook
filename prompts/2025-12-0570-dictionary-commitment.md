-   `DICTIONARY` defines terms and their meanings that the agent should use during its reasoning and responses.
-   Each line starting with `DICTIONARY` should be followed by a term and its definition.
-   The agent should incorporate these definitions into generated `modelRequirements.systemMessage` to ensure it uses the specified terminology correctly.
-   For the commitment `DICTIONARY` create its folder in `/src/commitments` and register it in the `/src/commitments/index.ts`
