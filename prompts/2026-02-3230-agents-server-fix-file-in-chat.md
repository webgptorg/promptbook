[✨🧰] When you add a file attachment, the chat agent can see only the metadata of the file, like the filename.

-   Fix it so the agent can see the content of the file in the message, not only the metadata.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
