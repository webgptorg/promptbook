[✨🌖] Allow to download file embeddded in chat message in <Chat/> component

In chat message, there can be embedded files, for example python code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

-   Alongside the embedded file, there should be a download button to download the file
-   <Chat/> component is [located in this file](/src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
