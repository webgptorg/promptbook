[✨🌖] When showing code in <Chat/> component, use syntax highliting

**In chat message, there can be embedded files, for example python code:**

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

-   When showing such code snippets in <Chat/> component, use syntax highlighting for better readability
-   Use Monaco Editor's syntax highlighting capabilities _(Monaco editor is already used in the project, reuse it)_
-   Use Monaco Editor in read-only mode for showing the code snippets
-   Allow to show syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages, not only python
-   <Chat/> component is [located in this file](/src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
