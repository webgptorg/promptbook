[✨☦️] Add capability to sync editor content with multiple users

-   Use `yjs` library with CRDT approach
-   This syncability should be passable via prop `BookEditor` which is by default turned off _(not defined prop)_, in `/apps/playground/src/app/sync/page.tsx` enable it and make the showcase of it
-   You are working on `/apps/playground/src/app/sync/page.tsx`
-   You are working on `/src/apps/book-components/BookEditor/BookEditorMonaco.tsx`
-   The `yjs`, `y-monaco` and `y-websocket-server` are already installed
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
