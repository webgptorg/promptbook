[✨🌺] All agent should be accessible through the `/[agentName]`

-   Now the agents are accessible through `/agents/[agentName]`
-   Change it such each agent is accessible through the root `/[agentName]` but also keep the old route `/agents/[agentName]` working, do not do any redirects, both routes should work the same way
-   On the root `/` page, change the links to agents to point to the new route `/[agentName]`
-   All the subroots of agents should work on the `/agents/[agentName]/...` route as before, for example `/agents/[agentName]/chat` is the chat page of the agent and the `/[agentName]/chat` route should be redirected to `/agents/[agentName]/chat`
-   QR code and copyable link for sharing the agent should use the new route `/[agentName]` regardless of which route the user is currently using
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
