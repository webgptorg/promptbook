[✨🐾] On Agent page add email adress of the agent

-   On the Agent page `/[agentName]` add a section which shows the email adress of the agent, for example `agentName@s6.ptbk.io` _(instead of `s6.ptbk.io` use the actual domain of the Agents Server deployment)_
-   Add this alongside with a section "Agent Page URL"
-   The idea of this sections is to have misc ways how to connect with the agent
-   You are doing just a mock, no real email or backend sending needed
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.

[✨🐾] On Agent page, the QR code should show valid VCARD of the agent, not just its url

-   Put agentName, url and email adress in the VCARD
-   Change text under the QR code from "Scan to open agent" to "Scan to contact"
-   Allow to pick between two qrs "Scan to contact" / "Scan to open agent", do it in some UI/UX elegant way, the "Scan to contact" is default
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
