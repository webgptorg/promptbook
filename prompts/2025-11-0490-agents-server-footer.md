[✨😦] Create Promptbook agents server footer

-   Footer should be on all pages where there is [header](/apps/agents-server/src/components/Header/Header.tsx)
-   Bring the footer from [ptbk.io landing page](C:/Users/me/work/promptbook-experiments-and-landing-pages/ptbk-landing-page/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx)
-   Allow to configure via metadata `FOOTER_LINKS` the extra links that will be shown in the footer
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
