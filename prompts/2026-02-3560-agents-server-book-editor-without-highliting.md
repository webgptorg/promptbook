[✨𓀐] Book editor is sometimes rendered without highliting, fix it

-   Happens only sometimes.
-   I see a pattern that it happens when the editor is rendered for the second time on the same loaded page without page reload, but I am not sure about it.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start fixing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
