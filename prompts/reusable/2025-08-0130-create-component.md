[âœ¨ðŸ’ž] Create component `AvatarProfile` and `AvatarProfileFromSource`

This should show the box with user avatar, name and description.
Its bit similar to the `<AvatarChip />` component but larger and with bit more details.

-   Take inspiration from other components here `/src/book-components/`
    -   Especially `/src/book-components/AvatarProfile/AvatarChip/AvatarChip.tsx`
-   Put in under `/src/book-components/AvatarProfile/AvatarProfile`
-   Make both `.tsx` and `.module.css` files
-   Make preview component
    -   Look at folder `/scripts/book-components/src/components`
    -   Look how other previews are made
        -   Make a preview component
        -   Also a `component.json` file
        -   Register it in `/scripts/book-components/src/components/ComponentPreview.tsx`
-   Keep in mind DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
