[✨😌] Write `/src/_packages/color.readme.md`

- Look at other READMEs how they are done
- Do not be confused here - `/src/_packages/*.readme.md` are the source READMEs where you should look like, in `/packages/*/README.md` are generated files
- You are writing the source README, generated one is not in your competence and will be generated automatically
