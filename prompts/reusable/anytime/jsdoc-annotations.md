[✨🏗] Do fulltext search of "@@@" across the repository and write text and annotations there

-   The "@@@" is used as placeholder for some text that need to be filled
-   It is used as placeholder for JSDoc annotations that need to be added into codebase
-   Search for all occurences of "@@@" in the repository

Do not write anything in theese files, the @@@ is intended to be there:

-   /prompts/2025-12-0810-jsdoc-annotations.md
-   /apps/\_boilerplate/src/app/layout.tsx
-   /prompts/\*
