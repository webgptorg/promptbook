[✨🗻] Fix the width of the Agents server app in the Samsung browser

-   The app overflows the screen width in the Samsung browser, fix it so it fits the screen properly.
-   The Samsung browser also doesnt properly load the fonts
-   This isnt a problem in other browsers, just the Samsung one
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
