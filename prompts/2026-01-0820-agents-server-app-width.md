[✨🗻] Fix the width of the Agents server app in the Samsung browser

-   The app overflows the screen width in the Samsung browser, fix it so it fits the screen properly.
-   The Samsung browser also doesnt properly load the fonts
-   This is not a problem in other browsers, just the Samsung Internet
-   It seems like a problem with the `Chat` component because this component make troubles with the width grater than 100% of the screen, but it is not clear why it happens only in the Samsung browser and not in other browsers, so you need to investigate and find the root cause of the problem and fix it.
-   You have tryed to fix this problem multiple times, but it is still not fixed, so make sure to investigate it properly and find the root cause of the problem and fix it.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
