[✨🎠] Enhance caching of GPT assistants created for agents on agents server

-   Every agent creates underlying GPT assistant.
-   Now, these assistants are created every time an chat session is started.
-   Improve caching of these assistants so that if two agents have the same configuration (model, system prompt, temperature, etc), the same assistant instance is reused.
-   This will save resources and improve performance when multiple agents with similar configurations are used.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
