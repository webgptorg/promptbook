[✨🚨] Commit the commits from the coding script as the agent, not as the user, in the git.

-   The git commit should not be authored by the primary user but by the agent.
-   Identity should be configurable, create a process that will make this identity.
-   Git commmits should be signed with the GPG key of the agent, not the user. This is important for the security and trust of the commits.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of the coding script before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [coding script](scripts/run-codex-prompts/run-codex-prompts.ts)
