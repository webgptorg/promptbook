USE BROWSER
```

-   `USE BROWSER` indicates that the agent should utilize a web browser tool to access and retrieve up-to-date information from the internet when necessary.
-   The contents of this commitment _(what follows after "USE BROWSER", like "USE BROWSER contents foo bar ...")_ has no effect and is ignored _(simmilar to `NOTE`)_
-   This is the first commitment in family of commitments `USE`, there will be more in future, e.g., `USE SEARCH ENGINE`, `USE FILE SYSTEM`, `USE MCP`, etc. _(Its simmilar principle to `META IMAGE`, `META LINK`, `META COLOR`,... commitment family, look how they are handled)_
-   For the commitment `USE BROWSER` create its folder in `/src/commitments` and register it in the `/src/commitments/index.ts`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   To implement the actual browser use You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
