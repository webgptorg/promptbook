[✨📔] Show ongoing tool calls before the message is completed.

-   There are two call chips shown below every message, but these chips are shown only when the message is 100% complete.
-   Show these chips when the message is still being streamed, and update them in real time as the tool calls are being made.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, share the logic of non-complete and complete chips
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
