[✨🙅] Implement propper server migrations in Agents Server

-   Agent server is using Supabase as database
-   Agent server is deployed through Vercel
-   Now there is no proper database migration system implemented, just `/apps/agents-server/src/database/schema.sql`
-   Relevant file is `/apps/agents-server/src/database/$provideSupabaseForServer.ts`
-   It should work for example in the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
