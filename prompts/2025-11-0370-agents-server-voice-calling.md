[✨✷] Add voice calling support to Agents Server

-   Implement voice calling functionality for agents hosted on the Agents Server
-   Implement entrire vertical from UI to implementation in `RemoteAgent`, `Agent`, api endpoints, database, etc.
-   Voicecalling should work alongside the working text messaging
-   You are communicating with same agent, just different modality
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
