[✨👀] Enhance UX of the menu on mobile / touch devices

expanding subfolders on touchscreens

-   User on the mobile cannot click on the sub-item because he can open the top level item, but then, when he clicks on the sub-item, it closes the first level item menu.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of the menu before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
