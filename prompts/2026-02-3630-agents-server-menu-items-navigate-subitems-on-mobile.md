[✨👀] Fix UX of the menu for touch devices

-   User on the mobile cannot click on the menu sub-item because he can open the top level item, but then, when he clicks on the sub-item, it closes the first level item menu together with the sub-item menu and he cannot click on the sub-item
-   This occures on mobile / touch devices
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of the menu and subitems before you start implementing.
-   After proper analysis, implement the solution which will have great UX for all devices
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
