[✨💎] Create a simple miniapp that can do realtime voicecall

-   Use the ElevenLabs API to create the miniapp
-   Miniapp will be encapsulated in a React component `<ElevenLabsRealtimeAgent />` that can be used in any Next.js page
-   The visual should be just a abstract circle representing the agent, with a button to start / stop the voicecall
-   Voicecall is real-time
-   Allow to pass system message through prop into the <ElevenLabsRealtimeAgent systemMessage="..." /> component
-   The sample should be located on `/elevenlabs-realtime-agent`, `http://localhost:4023/elevenlabs-realtime-agent`, place there the `<ElevenLabsRealtimeAgent />` component with some boilerplate configuration
-   You are working with the `Playground app` application `/apps/playground`
-   In the repository there is lot of other code, do not be distracted by it, focus only on the task of creating the miniapp as described working standalone
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
