[ ] !

[✨🥴] The chat is forcibly scrolled down to the bottom. Fix it.

-   User cannot scroll up to the earlier messages.
-   This happens only sometimes, but it's extremely annoying.
-   Do not hijack the scrolling when you don't need to. Only scroll to the bottom when a new message is added and the user is already at the bottom and the new message appears, otherwise, if the user has scrolled up, do not scroll down.
-   The user scroll should have higher priority than the application wanted scroll.
-   This should work both on desktop and mobile.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of chat and scrolling before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server) with a agent chat
