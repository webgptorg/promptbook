[✨⚽️] Enhance the UI of the collapsed sidebar with my chats.

-   Collapsed previous chats in the sidebar aren't looking good. A lot of the elements are overfloating or just look terrible. Enhance it.
-   This change is relevant only for the desktop. On the mobile phone, the sidebar is hidden when collapsed.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current design before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
