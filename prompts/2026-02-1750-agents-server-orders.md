[✨🚣] Menus in the Agent Server application aren't in the right order (z-index).

-   The agent context menu should be always above the agent items in the folder list view. (For example in http://localhost:4440/)
-   The hamburger menu content should be always above the context menu or any other element which is connected with the agent. (For example in http://localhost:4440/agents/wzDLdftjszrSLC)

-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
