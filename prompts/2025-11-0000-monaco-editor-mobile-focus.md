[✨🎳] On mobile devices `BookEditorMonaco` steals scrolling from the main page content

-   When user tab and scrolls inside the main flow of the page, the `BookEditorMonaco` steals the scroll events and scrolls itself instead of letting the main page scroll.
-   Require that `BookEditorMonaco` only captures scroll events when it is focused (i.e. user has tapped inside it).
-   Only change touch devices behavior, on PC the behavior should remain the same as it is now.
-   This update should improve usability on mobile devices.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`
