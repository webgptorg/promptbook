[✨𓀈] Allow to toggle feedback via metadata `IS_FEEDBACK_ENABLED` by default `true`

-   When the feedback is enabled, the behavior should be the same as now.
-   When the feedback is disabled, the users should not see the feedback star button in the chat
-   Also hide the feedback item from the menu.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)

### Metadata of Agents server
