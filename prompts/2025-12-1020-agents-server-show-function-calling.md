[✨🎞] Whan the agent call a tool, show it in the interface of <Chat/>

-   For example, when the agent calls a search tool, show the spinner or loading indicator with a tool name "Searching..." or similar.
-   This is part of the UI and UX of `isComplete=false` messages in the `<Chat/>` component
-   It should work universally for all tools called by the agent. There is nothing specific with search engine here, it's just an example.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server` but it should work generally for all applications using llm execution with tools.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
