[✨💕] Translate the agent server

-   Create metadata `SERVER_LANGUAGE` by default `en`
-   Create English and Czech translation.
-   Each translation should have its place, It should be like a plug-in for the agent server. It should be very easy to add new languages, Keep in mind solid principles to do it well.
-   This will not determine the language of the agents but the default language of the server.
    -   Do not be confused by the commitment `LANGUAGE`. This is a completely different concept, because this determines the language of the agent.
-   Add the Language Switcher into Control panel in the menu, Alongside picking sounds or private mode
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
