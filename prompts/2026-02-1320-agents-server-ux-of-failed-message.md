[✨🕴] Do not show ugly technical fail messages in a chat

> Sorry, I encountered an error processing your message. NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.

-   Instead of this message, we should show a nice message from a metadata `CHAT_FAIL_MESSAGE` that can be set for the agent server. By default, it can be something like "Sorry, I encountered an error processing your message. Please, try again later."
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
