[✨🐚] Implement chat streaming in Agents server

-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   You should implement streaming into `apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/api/chat/route.ts` and `apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/chat/AgentChatWrapper.tsx`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
