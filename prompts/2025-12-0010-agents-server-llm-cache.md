[✨🧎] Implement LLM cache for the Agents Server

-   In Agents Server, implement a caching mechanism using `cacheLlmTools` and as storage use the Supabase table `LlmCache`
-   Create table and database migration for that with table name `LlmCache`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
