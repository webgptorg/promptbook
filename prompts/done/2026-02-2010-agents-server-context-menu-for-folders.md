[✨⏹] Make context menu for folders.

context menu for folders

-   There is a custom context menu for the agents. Make a similar context menu for the folders.
-   In this context, menu should be only relevant items for the folders.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality and agent context menu before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
