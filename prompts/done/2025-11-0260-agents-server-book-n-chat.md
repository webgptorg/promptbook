[✨🐅] Add page book + chat

-   In Agent page `/[agentName]` add two buttons: `Chat` and `Edit`, add the button in the middle which combines both: `Book + Chat`
-   When user clicks the `Book + Chat` it should go to page `/agents/[agentName]/book+chat` which shows both the Book Editor on left and Chat component on right side
-   Use `<ResizablePanelsAuto/>` component to make the two panels layout
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle - this is important, make common abstractions where possible, do not repeat code in `/agents/[agentName]/book+chat`, `/agents/[agentName]/book` and `/agents/[agentName]/chat` pages and components.
