[✨🏀] `<Chat>` component should have prop `isCopyButtonEnabled`

-   When `isCopyButtonEnabled` is `true`, each message in the chat should have a small "copy" button in the top-right corner of the message bubble
-   By default, `isCopyButtonEnabled` is `true`
-   Chat component is in /src/book-components/Chat/Chat/Chat.tsx
-   Add sample (scenario) with and without copy buttons in preview http://localhost:4022/component/chat
-   Copy to clipboard multiple formats
-   Plain text
-   Formatted text
-   Add this new feature to the `ChatPreview`, `MockedChatPreview` and `LlmChatPreview` component.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`
