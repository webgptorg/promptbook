[x] $0.00 by Gemini CLI

[✨🤷] Add timing when coding agent.

-   When the coding agent script, Write the price and the coding runner after the prompt checkmark
-   Add there also a time - how much time has the prompt task been running
-   Use `moment` to format it in a human way.
-   For example:
    -   Old: "[ ] !!" -> "[x] ~$0.00 by Gemini CLI "
    -   New: "[ ] !!" -> "[x] ~$0.00 2m by Gemini CLI"
-   Coding script shouldn't be changed in any other way. It should stay the same, only adding the time reporting in one coding runner.
-   You are working with the [coding agent script](./scripts/run-codex-prompts/run-codex-prompts.ts)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
