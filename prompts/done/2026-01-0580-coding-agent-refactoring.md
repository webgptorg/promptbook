[✨🗒] Do the re-organization of the coding agent script, move the things into folders and files relative to their responsibilities

-   Each Runner and all of its utilities should have their own folder.
-   Common things should be in common folder.
-   One thing in one file.
-   You are doing the refactoring. Do not change the behavior in any way.
-   You are working with the [coding agent script](./scripts/run-codex-prompts/run-codex-prompts.ts)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, no code duplication, when needed create utility functions and reuse them.
