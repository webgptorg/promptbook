[✨🍴] Add chat directly on Agent page

-   On the Agent page `/[agentName]` add the Chat component to be able to chat with the agent directly on the main Agent page
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle - this is important, make common abstractions where possible, do not repeat code in `/[agentName]` and `/agents/[agentName]/chat` pages and components.
