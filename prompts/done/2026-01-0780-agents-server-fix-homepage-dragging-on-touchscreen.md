[x] ~$0.40 by OpenAI Codex `gpt-5.2-codex`

[✨🪑] Fix the drag-and-drop feature for the touchscreens on the home page of the agents server.

-   You can drag the agents on the home page.
-   By dragging, you can reorder the agents or drag and drop them in and out of the folders.
-   This is working perfectly on desktops, but not very well on touchscreens.
-   The feature itself is working fine on touchscreens, but it is triggered randomly when scrolling through the page.
-   Implement a better way to distinguish between scrolling and dragging on touchscreens.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)

[✨🪑] Fix the drag-and-drop feature for the touchscreens on the home page of the agents server.

-   You can drag the agents on the home page.
-   By dragging, you can reorder the agents or drag and drop them in and out of the folders.
-   This is working perfectly on desktops, but not very well on touchscreens.
-   The feature itself is working fine on touchscreens, but scrolling through the page is blocked.
-   Implement a better way to distinguish between scrolling and dragging on touchscreens.
-   Do it via drag handle - a specific visually distinct area on the agent card that is used for dragging. This way, the rest of the card can be used for scrolling without triggering the drag-and-drop feature.
-   The drag handle should be intuitive and easy to use on touchscreens, such as a small icon or a specific area on the card.
-   The drag handle should be visible on both desktop and mobile versions of the site and should work samely on both.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
