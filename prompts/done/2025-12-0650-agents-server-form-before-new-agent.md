[✨😛] When creating new agent open simple popup to confirm the newly created `agentSource`

-   Now when creating a new agent in the Agents Server it generates a boilerplate and immediately creates the agent.
-   Instead, after the boilerplate is generated, open a simple popup/modal that shows the generated `agentSource` code and asks the user to confirm or edit it before finalizing the creation of the new agent.
-   In this popup, show the prepopulated `agentSource` in a `BookEditor` component so the user can edit it if needed.
-   User can proceed by clicking "Create Agent" button or cancel the creation.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle
    -   Look how modals/popups are implemented in the `Agents Server` application and reuse the existing components.
    -   Look for opportunities to reuse existing code and components.
