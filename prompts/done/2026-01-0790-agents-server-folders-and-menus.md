[✨🖍] Allow to Open agent in new tab from its context menu click of the agent.

-   We have intercepted the native context menu of the browser.
-   We want to add the option "Open in new tab" to the context menu when right-clicking on an agent in the Agents Server application.
-   This is probably only option which isn't relevant for the agent profile page but only for the right-click on the agent in the directory listing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, especially the items in the context menu shouldn't be replicated in two separate places.

[✨🖍] You can see Agent organized by folders in the application menu.

-   Now, are all items shown at once, only with minor indentation
-   This is not very scalable, as if you have many agents and many folders, it will be a mess
-   Create proper item menus that are collapsible on hover
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
