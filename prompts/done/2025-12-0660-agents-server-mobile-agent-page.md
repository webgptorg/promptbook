[✨🛵] Enhance the mobile design of the agent page

-   The agent profile page `/agents/...` in the Agents Server application is not optimized for mobile devices.
-   Improve the mobile layout and design of the agent profile page to ensure a better user experience on smartphones
-   Show the agent card on entire width of the screen and initial message with quick actions below it
-   The page should look like:
    -   The header bar
    -   The agent card below the header, taking full width
    -   The initial message box below the agent card, also taking full width
    -   The footer
    -   There is no horizontal scrolling on mobile, just vertical scrolling
    -   There are no columns, everything is in a single column layout
-   The desktop version should look same as now
-   You are working with component [AgentProfile](/apps/agents-server/src/components/AgentProfile/AgentProfile.tsx)
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
