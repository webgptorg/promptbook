[✨💂] Enhance the ToolCall popup modals.

-   When the tool call is made, the user can click on the chip, and the popup modal shows the information about this tool call.
-   Enhance the design of this generic modal popup and make it look better.
-   It shouldn't be a technical model about the JSONs and the structure of the tool call request / response. It should be useful for the general public and look very nice and intuitive.
-   You are now enhancing generic tool call pop-up model. There are already some specific modals for some tools like `USE TIME`, `USE SEARCH ENGINE`, `MEMORY`,... but this is about the generic one, which is used for all the other tools.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
