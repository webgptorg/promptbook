[✨🐍] Reduce number of capability chips

-   Look at:
    -   Knowledgebase chips - Group them together if they are the same.
    -   Inheritaince chip `VOID` - Hide it, show only the ingeritance from other agents.
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
