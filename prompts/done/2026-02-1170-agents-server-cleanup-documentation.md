[✨🥐] Clean up the documentation. Not all commitments are such important that they need to be at the top, at the top level of the documentation item at the agent's server menu.

-   Important commitments are:
    -   `PERSONA`
    -   `KNOWLEDGE`
    -   `GOAL`
    -   `TEAM`
    -   `CLOSED`
    -   `INITIAL MESSAGE`
    -   `USE SEARCH ENGINE`
    -   All other commitments should be in the sub-item.
-   Create item in menu `Documentation` -> `All` _(last item)_ -> ...
    -   Use the system of sub-menus that are collapsible on hover
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
