[✨🪓] Create federated servers logic to Agents Server

-   Allow to specify multiple federated servers in the Agents Server metadata
-   Server will look to all federated servers and list their agents in the `/` after the "Agents" as "External Agents"
-   These will lead to the federated server agent page
-   Create API for federating
-   When A federates B and B federates C, A should also see C's agents
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.

-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
