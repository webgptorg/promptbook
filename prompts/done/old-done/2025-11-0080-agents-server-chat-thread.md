[✨♍️] When chatting with the agents, support chat threads _(previous message context)_

-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   You should implement chat threads into `apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/api/chat/route.ts` and `apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/chat/AgentChatWrapper.tsx`
-   In `callChatModel` the chat thereds are already supported, just use them
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
