[✨🚒] Enhance package readmes

-   Most of the READMEs in the project are outdated, incomplete, or missing important information.
-   It especially does not reflect what is exported from the packages in `*.index.ts` files.
-   The package readmes are in directory `/src/_packages`
    -   Each package has its `*.readme.md` file and `*.index.ts` file
    -   These `*.readme.md` has human-friendly part of the documentation, YOU WILL EDIT THESE
    -   The `*.index.ts` exports everything from the package, you will use this to see what is exported from the package to document it in the readme
    -   DO not be confused by `/packages` directory - it is autogenerated during the build and you should not edit or look into it
-   Each `*.readme.md` is just one part of bigger auto-generated README of the package
-   The `*.readme.md` should have at least these sections:
    -   Short description of the package and motivation why it exists
    -   Some high-level explanation of what the package does
    -   ✨ Some highlighted features of the package
    -   List of all exports from the package with short description of each export
-   The `*.readme.md` should NOT have these sections (these are autogenerated later):
    -   The h1 title of the package - it is autogenerated later
    -   Installation instructions
    -   Links to the website, docs, repo, issues,...
    -   License information
    -   Badges
    -   Anything which is mentioned in main `/README.md` of the project
