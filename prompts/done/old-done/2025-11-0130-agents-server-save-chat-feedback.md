[✨🥜] Allow to record feedback in Agents Server

-   Chat component supports feedback buttons (thumbs up / thumbs down) for agent responses
-   Now it is not set up in the Agents Server, implement the backend to save the feedback
-   Make api endpoint for feedback on agent responses `/apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/api/feedback/route.ts` and record to table `ChatFeedback`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
