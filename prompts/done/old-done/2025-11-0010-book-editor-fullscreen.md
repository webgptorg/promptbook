[✨🧡] The BookEditor when fullscreen should render above all other content

-   Use react portal to bypass nested BookEditor inside some `overflow:hidden` container
-   You are editing /src/book-components/BookEditor/BookEditor.tsx and/or /src/book-components/BookEditor/BookEditorMonaco.tsx
-   look at src/book-components/\_common/Tooltip/Tooltip.tsx how to do it
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
