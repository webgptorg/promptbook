[✨😀] Build process sometimes fails on `ECONNRESET`

-   It only happens sometimes. The next build is okay, and the build process ends successfully.
-   Analyze the problem and try to fix it.
-   If you cannot fix it, list possible reasons for the problem.

**This is the state how console looks like:**

```bash

  ● how creating knowledge from docx works › should scrape simple information from a (legacy) .doc file

    read ECONNRESET



  ● how creating knowledge from docx works › should scrape simple information from a (legacy) .doc file

    read ECONNRESET

    read ECONNRESET
