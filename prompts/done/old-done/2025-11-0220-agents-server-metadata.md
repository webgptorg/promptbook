[✨🦙] Create table `Metadata` to store misc options of `Agents Server`

-   Table `Metadata` should have columns:
    -   `key`
    -   `value`
    -   `note`
-   On `/metadata` page admin can list, create, modify and delete metadata entries, link this page from the heading bar when logged as admin
-   There should be predefined metadata entries which control essential options of the Agents Server:
    -   `SERVER_NAME` - name of the server, default is `Promptbook Agents Server`, displayed in the heading bar
-   Create a list of all metadata as `metadataDefaults.ts` file
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
