[✨🤯] Build process sometimes freezes during the `@promptbook/wizard` package

-   Problem occures during the build in
    command `ts-node ./scripts/generate-packages/generate-packages.ts --commit`
    in step `4️⃣  Generate bundle for each package`
-   It only happens sometimes. The next build is okay, and the build process ends successfully.
-   Even when it doesnt stuck it takes **up to hour** on a local machine
-   On Github Action `Publish new version` -> `Publish on NPM package registry` -> `🏭 Build packages bundles` -> `npx ts-node ./scripts/generate-packages/generate-packages.ts` it takes just about 5 ~ 6 minutes _(see the screenshot)_
-   Analyze the problem and try to fix it.
-   If you cannot fix it, list possible reasons for the problem.

**This is the state how console looks like:**
