[✨🫒] Samples should be loaded dynamically - [`BookEditorPreview.tsx`](/book-components/src/components/book-editor/BookEditorPreview.tsx) Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.

-   There should be NO hardcoded samples in the code and no duplicates
-   Load these books through api created in the [Next.js book-components project](/book-components)
-   The API path should be `/api/books` and implement it
