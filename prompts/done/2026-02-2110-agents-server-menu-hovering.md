-   With mouse, when hovering on menu, the menu is closed pretty soon after mouse moves and user cannot pick any of the items in the opened panel, fix it
-   With touch, when tapping on menu, you cannot access the subitems, only the first-level items, fix it
-   Create a great UX and UI for the items, sub-items, sub-sub-items, etc. in the menu.
-   It must feel natural and intuitive to use the menu and access any item or subitem in it, no matter which device you are using, mouse or touch.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server) with the menu items and subitems.
