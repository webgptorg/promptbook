[✨🦣] Allow to see agent history and implement a recycle bin

-   There is already history of agent's changes stored in the database in table `AgentHistory`
-   This table is now inaccessible from the UI and used only as bqackup
-   Allow to see the history of changes linked from agent profile page
-   Allow to restore the agent to any previous version from the history
-   Also, implement recycle bin for deleted agents
-   When agent is deleted, it should go to recycle bin first _(everything is already in database, just UI is missing)_
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
