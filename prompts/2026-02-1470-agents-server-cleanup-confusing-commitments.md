[✨🧟] Remove the commitment `IMAGE GENERATION`

-   This is very confusing because there is a commitment `USE IMAGE GENERATOR` which is working perfectly.
-   The `IMAGE GENERATION` commitment is not working and unused and it is not clear what it is supposed to do, and it is very confusing for the users and for the developers.
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)

[✨🧟] Remove the commitments `USE IMAGE GENERATION`, `USE IMAGE` and `IMAGE GENERATOR`

-   This is very confusing because there is a commitment `USE IMAGE GENERATOR` which is working perfectly.
-   The other commitments are not working and unused and it is not clear what they are supposed to do, and it is very confusing for the users and for the developers.
-   Do not be confused with the commitment `META IMAGE` - it is working as well and it has totally different functionality, it is not related to the image generation and it is not related to the `USE IMAGE GENERATOR` commitment, so it should not be removed or changed at all.
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
