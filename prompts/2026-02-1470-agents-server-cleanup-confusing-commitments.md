[✨🧟] Remove the commitment `IMAGE GENERATION`

-   This is very confusing because there is a commitment `USE IMAGE GENERATOR` which is working perfectly.
-   The `IMAGE GENERATION` commitment is not working and unused and it is not clear what it is supposed to do, and it is very confusing for the users and for the developers.
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
