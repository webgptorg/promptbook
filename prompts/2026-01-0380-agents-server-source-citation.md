[✨👗] Fix showing the document from which the agent sourced their information

-   The agents are telling correct information based on given documents, but they are not showing the source correctly
-   When the agent cites something, the user should be able to click on the source chip and show the document from the agent sourced its response.
-   You are working with the entire vertical from the object representing the LLMs and agents to the [Agents Server application](apps/agents-server)
-   This is probably a hard problem because you have tried to do it multiple times but failed - Analyze the problem deeply and come up with a robust solution.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle and other best practices.

    -   If there is something that I need to do, write me a detailed plan of what needs to be done and save it into the file in the root of the repository.
