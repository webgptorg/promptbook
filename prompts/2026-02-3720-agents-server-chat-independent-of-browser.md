[✨🍅] Chat should be independent of the browser.

-   By independence I mean several behavior changes:
    -   When looking on the same chat from two different browser windows. This chat should be synchronized.
    -   When user refreshes the chat during the streaming, it shouldn't matter. The agent response should be put into the chat independently whether the user is looking and is focused on the chat or not or from how many browsers windows
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of chats and agents before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   If you need to do the database migration, do it
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
