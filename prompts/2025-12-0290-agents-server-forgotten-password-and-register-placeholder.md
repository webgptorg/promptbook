[✨🚇] On user login form, add forgotten password link and register user

-   For now, there is no way to recover forgotten password or register new user so it will be only a placeholder
-   Show message "This Promptbook server has no email capability. Please contact the administrator at {ADMIN_EMAIL} to reset your password." where `{ADMIN_EMAIL}` is taken from Metadata
-   For register, show message "This Promptbook server has no email capability. Please contact the administrator at {ADMIN_EMAIL} to register new user."
-   Add `ADMIN_EMAIL` into `Metadata` and use it in Forgotten Password and Register emails
-   By default `ADMIN_EMAIL` is `support@ptbk.io`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
