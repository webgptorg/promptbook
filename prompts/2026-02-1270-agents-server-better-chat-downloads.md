[✨🗺] Enhanced HTML download of the chat.

-   Exported HTML version of the chat looks awful.
-   The design of the exported HTML should be much better, with proper formatting, colors, and images. It should look like a nice chat export that you can share with someone or keep for your records.
-   It should look as similar as the chat in the application.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
