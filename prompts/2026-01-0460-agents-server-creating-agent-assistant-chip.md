[✨📰] Show that the GPT assistant is pending in UI

When the agent has a very huge book, the duration of the creation of the underlying GPT assistant is pretty long. It can take, for example, multiple minutes of waiting. This has terrible user experience because the user is waiting and waiting and waiting for the first response.

Make some look how the chips or tool chips are implemented. For example, how it looks when the agent is using a source engine, or when the agent is self-learning, or when the agent is doing some job and create similar mechanism, but not during the call and after call like a self-learning, but before the call. This chip should show something like "Preparing" or "Creating agents", and the user should clearly see that something is happening. They should see that "Oh, now I'm in the phase when the agent is preparing this". This will happen once, and then the GPT assistant is created. At the second call, the preparation won't show because the agent is already cached, but the UI will be much better.
