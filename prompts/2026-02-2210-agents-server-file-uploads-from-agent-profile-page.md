[✨💭] Allow uploading files from the agent profile page.

-   In the agent chat page of the agent, you can upload files if this feature is allowed on the server.
-   But the same feature isn't available from the agent profile page. Implement it.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)

[✨💭] Fix uploading files from the agent profile page.

-   In the agent chat page of the agent, you can upload files if this feature is allowed on the server.
-   Same feature is available from the agent profile page
    -   It looks like the file is attached to the message, it is successfully uploaded
    -   But when you send the message, the file isn't sent to the agent chat, message is sent without the file, and the file is not visible in the agent chat.
-   Fix it so the file is properly sent to the agent chat and visible in the agent
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality between agent profile page and agent chat page before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
