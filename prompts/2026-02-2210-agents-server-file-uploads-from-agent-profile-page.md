[✨💭] Allow uploading files from the agent profile page.

-   In the agent chat page of the agent, you can upload files if this feature is allowed on the server.
-   But the same feature isn't available from the agent profile page. Implement it.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
