[✨🏦] Simplify the design of the agent page

-   Agent page has pathname `/agents/[agentName]`
-   Current design has too much information and clutter, it should have just:
    -   Visually appealing and good looking agent profile
    -   Ability to start chat with the agent
-   All the links and complexity should be hidden in a dropdown menu or "More options" menu
-   Look for inspiration at attachment photo
-   It should visually match the Agent color theme, use `Color` object to create matching colors for background, buttons, etc.
-   Use some nice font for the agent name, like `Poppins`, `Montserrat`, `Raleway`, `Nunito`, etc.
-   Use nice rounded cards with Agent image
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
