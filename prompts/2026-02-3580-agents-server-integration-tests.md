[✨🚿] Create integration tests for Agents server

-   Create integration tests for the Agents Server, covering all major functionalities and user flows.
-   Use a Playwright for end-to-end testing, and ensure that tests are reliable and maintainable.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of the testing, build pipelines and other related functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are covering just the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server) not the whole Promptbook engine
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
