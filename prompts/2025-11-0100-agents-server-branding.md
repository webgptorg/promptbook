[✨🍛] Homepage of the Agents Server should display heading bar

-   Look at `C:/Users/me/work/promptbook-experiments-and-landing-pages/aldaron/components/header.tsx` how the heading bar is implemented there and should look like
-   Same heading bar is in ptbk.io website and in attached screenshot
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
