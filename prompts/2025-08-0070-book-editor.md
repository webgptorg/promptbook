[âœ¨ðŸ‘²] Reimplement component `BookEditor` to use

---

[x]

[âœ¨ðŸ‘²] [BookEditor](/src/book-components/BookEditor/BookEditor.tsx) `BOOK_EDITOR_STYLES` should be put to css modules

```typescript
import styles from './BookEditor.module.css';
```

-   For the [Next project](/src/book-components) it should work as it was its css module
-   For package `@promptbook/components` it should be put into [its build process](/scripts/generate-packages/generate-packages.ts)

When someone uses the `BookEditor` component from the package `@promptbook/components`, it should have the styles applied.
