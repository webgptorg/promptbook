[✨🛗] Fix missing referenced agents on desktop

-   When you reference some agent which is not found, you will have a quick option to create it.
-   This option is shown only on mobile but not on desktop. This is a bug, it should be shown on desktop as well.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
