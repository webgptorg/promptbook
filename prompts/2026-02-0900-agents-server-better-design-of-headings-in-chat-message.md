[✨🤧] Enhance the design of headings in the chat messages.

-   Chat messages can contain headings because they can be formatted in Markdown.
-   Some of the Markdown features look great, but headings look pretty bad.
-   The headings should be more visually better
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, there should be one design language shared across the project.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
