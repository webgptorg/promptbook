[✨👨] Show loading state when uploading files

-   User can drag and drop files into the Book Editor to upload them.
-   When user uploads files, now there is no loading state shown to the user. At first it seems that nothing is happening. Then after some time the files appear in the Book Editor.
-   Add a loading state indicator when files are being uploaded.
-   The loading state should be placeholder text in place where the files will appear once uploaded, placeholder text should be `file.name`
-   Implement this feature into `<BookEditor onFileUpload={...} />`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   You are working with the `/apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/book/BookEditorWrapper.tsx` and `/src/book-components/BookEditor/BookEditor.tsx`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
