[✨🧙] Preserve headless mode

-   There is a GET search param `?headless` which disables header and footer
-   When navigating within the Agents Server app, for example from agent page to book page, or from book page to chat page, the `headless` param is lost
-   Preserve the `headless` param when navigating within the app
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
