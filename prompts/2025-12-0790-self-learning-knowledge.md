[✨🏡] Agents should be able to learn new knowledge

-   When the `agentSource` book is `OPEN` _(not closed)_ the `agentSource` is automatically modified during the conversation
-   Now the self-learning works only as appending `USER MESSAGE` and `AGENT MESSAGE` at the end of the conversation after the agent replys
-   Extend the self-learning functionality to allow the agent to also update its `KNOWLEDGE` sections based on the conversation context.
-   For example, if during the conversation the user provides new information or corrects the agent, the agent should be able to incorporate that information by creating or updating the `KNOWLEDGE` commitments at the end of its `agentSource`
-   It should work for example in `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
