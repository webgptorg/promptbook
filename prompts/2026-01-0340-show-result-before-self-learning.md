[✨⚖️] Show result before self-learning

-   Agents can do self-learning, but when the self-learning is happening, the user is still waiting for the response.
-   This leads to bad user experience, because user cannot see any result until the self-learning is finished.
-   Show the answer from the agent first, then do the self-learning asynchronously.
-   When the self-learning is happening, show a similar chip to when, for example, search or consultation with another agent is happening.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Keep in mind other best practices, do it right and architecturally sound.
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
