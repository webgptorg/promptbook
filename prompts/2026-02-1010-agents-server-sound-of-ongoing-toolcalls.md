[✨📚] The agent uses some tool and show the tool calling chip. Play the sound and use the vibration.

-   The sound should be played and the vibration should be triggered when the tool calling chip is shown. This will provide a more immersive and engaging experience for users, making it clear that the agent is actively using a tool.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, Use existing sound system for this.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
