[✨😃] Create a page that will allow to test the image generator

-   It should be aviable on `/admin/image-generator-test` in Agents Server
-   Add link to the [menu](apps/agents-server/src/components/Header/Header.tsx) under "Systems" > "Image Generator Test"
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.

[✨😃] Implement the (generated) images gallery of the Agents server

-   Agent server can generate images
-   Thee generated images can be either avatar image of the agent or images generated by the testing page
-   Either way, we need a gallery page to list all the generated images
-   Allow to show the images in a two ways:
    -   Table with the images and details in a columns, use pagination
    -   Images in a gallery grid with infinite scroll
-   It should be aviable on `/admin/images` in Agents Server
-   Add link to the [menu](apps/agents-server/src/components/Header/Header.tsx) under "Systems" > "Images gallery"
-   Create database migration on `Image` table to store both purposes of the image and agent _(nullable for testing images)_
    -   Migrations are located in `/apps/agents-server/src/database/migrations`
    -   Be aware that table names in migrations have prefix `prefix_` _(look at existing migrations for reference)_
    -   When using table names in supabase queries, use the `$getTableName` utility function to get the correct table name with prefix, for example: `await supabase.from(await $getTableName('Agent')).select('...')`
    -   Update the schemas in `/src/collection/agent-collection/constructors/agent-collection-in-supabase/AgentCollectionInSupabase.ts` and `/src/collection/agent-collection/constructors/agent-collection-in-supabase/AgentsDatabaseSchema.ts`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.

[✨😃] Implement files listing of the Agents server

-   Agents server can store files which are either uploaded by users or generated by agents
-   We need a page to list all the files stored in the server
-   Look how images gallery `/admin/images` is implemented for reference
-   It should be aviable on `/admin/files` in Agents Server
-   Add link to the [menu](apps/agents-server/src/components/Header/Header.tsx) under "Systems" > "Files"
-   Create database migration on `File` table to store associated agent _(nullable for files not associated with any agent)_
    -   Migrations are located in `/apps/agents-server/src/database/migrations`
    -   Be aware that table names in migrations have prefix `prefix_` _(look at existing migrations for reference)_
    -   When using table names in supabase queries, use the `$getTableName` utility function to get the correct table name with prefix, for example: `await supabase.from(await $getTableName('Agent')).select('...')`
    -   Update the schemas in `/src/collection/agent-collection/constructors/agent-collection-in-supabase/AgentCollectionInSupabase.ts` and `/src/collection/agent-collection/constructors/agent-collection-in-supabase/AgentsDatabaseSchema.ts`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
