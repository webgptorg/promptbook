## User data

-   There are users in the agent server.
-   These users are more like administrators. Not every visitor should be logged in; only administrators are logged in.
-   For the anonymous users, there is created a temporary AdHoc user.
-   User data are stored in a database.
-   The ad-hoc user is identified in the cookies.
-   The logged-in user is also identified in the cookies.
