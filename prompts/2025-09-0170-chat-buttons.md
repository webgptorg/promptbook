[âœ¨ðŸŽ†] The `Chat` component should be able to work with predefined messages buttons

-   Buttons are defined in last shown message, for example:

```markdown
This is message text with _some formatting_

[Say Hello](?message=Hello!)
[Ask for help](?message=I need help with ...)
[Just say thanks](?message=Thanks!)
```

-   The buttons should be rendered only for the last message in the chat
-   When user clicks on the button, the message defined in the button should be sent as new message from the user
-   The message in the button is defined in the `message` query parameter in the button
-   The button can have some text (with markdown formatting)
-   Put example into `<ChatPreview/>`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `CHANGELOG.md`
