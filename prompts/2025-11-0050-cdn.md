[✨🔬] Allow to upload files to `<BookEditor/>`, create `DigitalOceanSpaces` CDN

-   Allow to upload files in apps/agents-server/src/app/agents/[agentName]/book/BookEditorWrapper.tsx
-   Prop `onFileUpload` will recieve the file and should return the public url of the uploaded file on CDN
-   For CDN base url use `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL`, uploaded file shouldt be exposed directly on `CDN_PUBLIC_URL` but through our domain `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL`
-   Create the required api routes, create the CDN
-   CDN should be providable from /apps/agents-server/src/tools/$provideCdnForServer.ts
-   Take the logic from C:\Users\me\work\webgptorg\promptbook-studio\src\pages\api\upload-knowledge.ts , look at this file + its dependencies ,...
-   Bring also `IFilesStorage`, `IIFilesStorageWithCdn` and `DigitalOceanSpaces`
-   You have already configured `CDN_BUCKET`, `CDN_PATH_PREFIX`, `CDN_ENDPOINT`, `CDN_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `CDN_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `CDN_PUBLIC_URL`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
