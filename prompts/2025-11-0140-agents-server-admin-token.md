[✨👹] Implement admin and user permissions

-   There will be `process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable set in the environment, it will be admin password
-   This is just lightweight permissions system, no user accounts, just one hardcoded admin password
-   This will be just light implementation of the permissions system for Agents Server, one admin token, just admin and non-admin anonymous users, propper user system will be implemented later, mark all the places with:
    -   `// TODO: [👹] Implement proper user system`
    -   `/* <- TODO: [👹] Here should be user permissions */`
    -   ... etc
-   When `process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD` not set, then all users are admins _(current behaviour)_
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
