    "modelName": "gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "topP": 0.9,
    "topK": 50,
    "metadata": {
        "agentName": "Testing time",
        "isClosed": true
    },
    "parentAgentUrl": null,
    "tools": [],
    "samples": [
        {
            "question": null,
            "answer": "How can I assist you today?"
        }
        {
            "question": "What date is  it?",
            "answer": "Today is  October 2, 2023."
        }
    ]
}
```

-   Modify the interface of the `samples` such as `question` can be `null`.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
