[✨🗑] Fix the Book editor when user Press to upload a lot of files.

-   When user drags files or presses the upload button and selects a lot of files, not all files are uploaded.
-   Fix the problem so that user can upload a lot of files without any issues.
-   Upload progress should be shown in the UI.
-   Also upload the files in chunks of 5 _(put 5 it into the constants)_ to not overload the server.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
