[✨🤡] Auto-Federate https://core.ptbk.io/

-   You can federate servers by using `FEDERATED_SERVERS` metadata
-   There shpuld be also a list of servers that are auto-federated _(no need to list them explicitly)_
-   Add this as config value to file `/servers.ts`
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
