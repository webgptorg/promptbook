[✨🍥] Reflect changes from book to chat in real time

-   For example changing `INITIAL MESSAGE` channge the initial message in chat right away
-   But if the conversation has already started, do not change the initial message in the middle of the conversation, just mark it as outdated
-   Also chat with the current source of the book, not the initial source when page was loaded
-   But keep the chat history intact when source changes
-   Add new flag into message object `ChatMessage.isFromOutdatedSource: boolean` to indicate that message was generated from outdated source
-   Make some visual indication in chat UI for messages that are from outdated source _(grayscale and opacity)_
-   You are working on the page `/agents/[agentName]/book+chat` where book and chat are shown side by side
-   You are working with the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
