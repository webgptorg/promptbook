[✨🤶] Create some files at root of the project

-   Read content of `nonce-foo-1.txt` and create a new file named `nonce-foo-2.txt` with the same content.
-   Read content of `nonce-bar-1.txt` and create a new file named `nonce-bar-2.txt` with the same content.
-   This task is just to test the coding agent functionality that can read existing files and create new files based on that.
