[✨🎫] When the user is switching between his chats, the user experience isn't great.

-   It blinks a lot of times, double refreshing, and a lot of times the user sees just loading.
-   It eventually loads, but the UX and the duration of the process are terrible.
-   Switching the chat or creating a new one should be smooth and nice. It shouldn't blink; it should just smoothly create and switch to the new or old chat.
-   New chat button shouldnt reset the current chat but create new chat
    -   By this change, chats became kinda immutable, you can just go on or create new one
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current chats are stored and rendered before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
