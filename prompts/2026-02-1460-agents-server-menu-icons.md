[✨👍] Menu of the agent server app should have icons in the menu bar before the agent name and the action name.

-   It will make the UI more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
-   Before the agent name, there should be a circle with the agent profile image.
-   Before the action (Profile/Chat/Book) should be icon get, inspiration from the Agent context menu.
-   This should be both in the closed and open state.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
