[✨📰] Agent with large knowledgebase takes sooooooo long to prepare and answer, and often just ends up stucked

-   It stuckes up on uploading files to vector store
-   Fix it or at least log more info about what is happening under the hood.
-   Logs connected to this issue are marked with `[🤰]` tag
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server) with the agent chat _(for example, [here](https://my-agent-server.com/agents/FVLv8APAf2S1WV/chat))_

**This is the log:**

```log
...
@@@
```

_<- The log ends here and never continues, just stucked on this point forever_
