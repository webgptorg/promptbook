[✨💓] When you click on the link anywhere in the agent server, the user doesn't see some feedback loading etc.

-   Try to indicate to the user that something is happening.
-   This is maybe some thing with Next.js Link component or with some global loading indicator?
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
