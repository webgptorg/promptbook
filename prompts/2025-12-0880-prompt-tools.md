[✨🈁] Allow to pass tools into the `ChatPrompt.modelRequirements.tools`

-   The tool calling functionality should be implemented for now only for OpenAiExecutionTools
-   Do some sample of tool use in [OpenAI Playground](/src/llm-providers/openai/playground/playground.ts)
-   You are working with [`ChatPrompt` type](/src/types/Prompt.ts) and [`ChatModelRequirements` type](/src/types/ModelRequirements.ts)
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Add the changes into the `/changelog/_current-preversion.md`
