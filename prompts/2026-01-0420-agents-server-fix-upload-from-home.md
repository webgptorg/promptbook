[✨🔉] When creating agents from the homepage of the agents server. The drag-and-drop upload of the file isn't working, fix it

-   Uploading of the files is working perfectly when editing the agent book.
-   However when creating a new agent from the homepage `/` from the popup modal dialog, the drag-and-drop upload of the file isn't working. Fix it.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle, the uploading code and entire logic should be reused.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
