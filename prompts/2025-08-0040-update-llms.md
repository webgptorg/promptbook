[âœ¨ðŸŽ°] In folder `src/llm-providers` there are listed available models _(for example OpenAI models are listed on `src/llm-providers/openai/openai-models.ts`)_ for multiple providers, update them.

-   Find the latest information on official and unofficial web pages
-   Find new models and add them to lists of available models
-   Deprecate models which are deprecated
-   Update pricing of all models _(often can happen that model price lowers over time so check all listed models)_
