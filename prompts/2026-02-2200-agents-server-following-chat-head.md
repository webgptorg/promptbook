[✨🦸] When the chat is writing a message and the user is already down in the latest chat head. Follow this chat head as the tokens are streamed down.

-   This should be ONLY when the user is already scrolled down in a chat. When the user starts manually scrolling, in any time, do not hijack his scroll.
-   First priority should be always on the scrolling of the user. The secondary should be on the following of the chat head.
-   This should work both on desktop and mobile.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of chat component before you start implementing.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
