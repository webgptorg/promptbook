[x] ~$1.00 24 minutes by OpenAI Codex `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`

[✨📀] By default, sounds should be turned off and the vibration turned on.

-   Allow to configure this through the metadata `DEFAULT_IS_SOUNDS_ON` (by default `false`) and `DEFAULT_IS_VIBRATION_ON` (by default `true`) which are boolean values _(similar to `IS_EXPERIMENTAL_VOICE_CALLING_ENABLED`)_.
-   Both of these can be separately toggled in the menu.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
