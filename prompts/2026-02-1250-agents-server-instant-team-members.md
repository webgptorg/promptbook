[✨👳] When the referenced team member is not found, Allow to instantly create it from the BookEditor

**For example:**

```book
AI Team manager

TEAM
You can discuss things with a {Lawyer}, {Copywriter}, and {Developer}.
```

-   When the "Lawyer", "Copywriter", or "Developer" and this team member is not existing, show on a right panel the message "Team member {name} is not found. Do you want to create it?" with a button "Create {name}".
-   When the user clicks the button, create this team member and add it into the team
-   These team members should be created in the same folder
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   This is a big change. Do a proper analysis of the project before you start implementing.
-   You have already implemented this in commit `d6f4e275ed95cf6acd14f59a013c3dc7c507221e`, but it doesn't work. Make sure to fix it and make it work properly.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
