[✨🧛] Create commitment `USE USER LOCATION`

-   This is a bit equivalent to `USE TIME` commitment, but for the user location.
-   For the user, it should look trivial, but the implementation will be harder.
-   The time can be determined on the server. On the other hand, user location needs to be requested from the user. The user needs to be requested by the browser, and this location should be transmitted back to the agent.
-   Do not ask user in browser for the location before the agent asks for the location.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality before you start implementing.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
