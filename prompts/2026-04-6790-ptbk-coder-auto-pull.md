[✨🈴] Add flag `--auto-pull` to `ptbk coder run`

```bash
npm install ptbk

ptbk coder run --agent github-copilot --model gpt-5.4 --thinking-level xhigh --context AGENTS.md --auto-pull
```

-   This is bit similar to `--auto-push` but controlled by separate flag
-   First pull should happen before the first prompt, so the agent will start with the most up-to-date codebase, and then after each prompt is commited, if there are changes in the git repository, the agent should pull the changes before the next prompt, so it will always work with the most up-to-date codebase
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   Do a proper analysis of the current functionality of `ptbk coder` and related functionality before you start implementing.
-   You are working with [`ptbk coder`](src/cli/cli-commands/coder/run.ts)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](./changelog/_current-preversion.md)
