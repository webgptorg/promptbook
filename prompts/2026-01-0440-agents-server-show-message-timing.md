[✨🚉] Show timing in the messages in the chat.

-   Show the time message was sent (for both user and agent) and also for the agent messages how long it takes to create the message.
-   This information should be stored in the `ChatMessage` object as `string_date_iso8601`
-   Showing of this information should be processed by `moment`.
-   Keep in mind good UX and UI.
-   User saves the chat. The information about the time (not duration of the message generation) should be saved in the exported chat.
-   Keep in mind the DRY _(don't repeat yourself)_ principle.
-   You are working with the [Agents Server](apps/agents-server)
-   Add the changes into the [changelog](changelog/_current-preversion.md)
