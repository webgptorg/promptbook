[✨🍝] `tldr` should report real progress of the task

-   Now it's reporting just `0` or `1` as a percentage; try to provide a better estimate.
-   At minimum, simulate progress by assuming the full task takes 5 minutes _(put this number in config)_, with progress evenly split across each subtask.
-   When querying the task via the HTTP server, report the proportional percentage.
-   The message should be like "working on xxx".
-   Look at `/src/remote-server/startRemoteServer.ts` and `/src/execution/ExecutionTask.ts`, but edit or create every file necessary for the implementation.
-   Keep in mind the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle.

[✨🍝] `tldr` should not be faked in `/src/execution/ExecutionTask.ts` but passed into `createTask` from `/src/execution/createPipelineExecutor/00-createPipelineExecutor.ts` and its internal logic.

-   try to provide a better estimate based on internal structure of executed pipeline
-   At minimum, simulate progress by assuming the full pipeline takes 5 minutes with progress evenly split across each subtask.
-   The message should be like "working on task 123".
-   Keep in mind the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle.

[✨🍝] Refactor `/src/execution/createPipelineExecutor/00-createPipelineExecutor.ts` and `createTask` in a such way that there is no `tldrProvider` passed in the `createTask` but alongside `updateOngoingResult` is `updateTldr`
