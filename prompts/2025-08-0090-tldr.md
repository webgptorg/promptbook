[✨🍝] tldr should report real progress of the task

-   Now its reporting just `0` or `1` as percentage, try to do better estimate
-   Try to at least fake the progress with assumptions that full task takes 5 minutes _(put this number to config)_ with evenly split by each subtask
-   When queriing the task via http server, count this proportional percetage
-   The message should be like "working on xxx"
-  Look at `/src/remote-server/startRemoteServer.ts` and `/src/execution/ExecutionTask.ts` but edit or create every file nessesary for the implementation
-   Keep in mind DRY *(dont repeat yourself)* principle
