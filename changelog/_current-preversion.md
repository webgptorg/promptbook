-   Upgraded shared markdown code-fence rendering (used across Agents Server chat/docs/profile/admin markdown surfaces) to Monaco-backed snippets with language-aware highlighting for JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Python, Shell, JSON, and SQL; added fence-alias normalization (`ts`/`typescript`, `js`/`javascript`, `sh`/`bash`, etc.), enforced plaintext fallback for unsupported languages, and isolated each snippet into its own Monaco model path so multiple mixed-language blocks do not interfere while staying responsive inside chat bubbles.
-   Fixed META DOMAIN routing so hosts like `search.ptbk.io` that are configured as an agent’s custom domain but point to the same server (for example `https://pavol-hejny.ptbk.io`) no longer hit the “server not configured” error: middleware now resolves the underlying server via META DOMAIN/ META LINK, reuses the proper Supabase table prefix, and rewrites straight to the agent profile while honoring the DRY alias lookup helper.
-   Fixed Agents Server touch submenu UX in the header: coarse-pointer/touch interactions now ignore hover-delay auto-close timers (which could dismiss parent dropdowns before nested item taps were processed), stale close timers are cleared when input mode changes, and desktop header dropdowns now close on outside tap in touch mode for predictable navigation.
-   Unified Agents Server chat/navigation arrow visuals to one reusable triangle `ArrowIcon` (`▶`): the left chat sidebar toggle, chat scroll-to-latest button, and header breadcrumb separators now share the same component with only direction/size changes (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`).
-   Enhanced `PromptbookAgentIntegration` seamless widget UX/design: upgraded the floating launcher and chat window with a cleaner modern visual hierarchy, smoother open/hover/loading transitions, improved connection-state feedback, stronger mobile polish, and better accessibility semantics (button behavior, focus-visible, Escape-to-close, and descriptive labels) while keeping the integration API unchanged.
-   Fixed Agents Server embedding/chat unification: `chat?headless` is now the single embed surface (the legacy `/iframe` route redirects to it), headless chat no longer renders the chat-selection sidebar while still persisting/recording chats, the headless route now keeps required chat providers in the layout (fixing `useSelfLearningPreferences` provider crashes), and `IS_EMBEDDING_ALLOWED` middleware/integration snippets now target `/agents/:agentName/chat?headless`.
-   Improved Agents Server Czech localization quality and coverage: polished existing Czech strings with context-aware wording/diacritics, translated footer labels/content, and localized admin user-management surfaces (`/admin/users`, user detail, delete-confirm dialog, and forbidden page) by extending shared server-language translation keys and both English/Czech catalogs.
-   Improved Agents Server chat speech UX and lifecycle handling: OpenAI dictation now detects end-of-speech faster with adaptive silence thresholds, emits an explicit transcribing phase, and always releases microphone/audio resources after recording so mobile/system audio is no longer left degraded by a lingering mic lock; chat input now also shows a floating speech-status bubble (starting/listening/transcribing/error) and shared DRY voice-state UI mapping for clearer real-time feedback.
-   Fixed Agents Server header touch navigation for nested menu branches: desktop-width touch/coarse-pointer devices no longer auto-close top-level dropdowns on blur/mouse-leave while expanding submenu folders, so nested entries (for example Documentation -> All -> PERSONA) can be tapped reliably; added an e2e regression test for this flow.
-   Refined the Agents Server header control panel UX with a cleaner sectioned layout, shared DRY section/toggle/status primitives, clearer at-a-glance state chips (privacy, learning, language), and a viewport-aware scrollable dropdown body so growing settings remain usable on smaller screens.
-   Unified arrow visuals in the Agents Server UI by introducing one shared `ArrowIcon` component (`apps/agents-server/src/components/_utils/ArrowIcon.tsx`) and replacing the previous mix of Lucide chevrons, ad-hoc text arrows, and the custom sidebar arrow implementation across header navigation, chat sidebar controls, admin galleries, story/export selectors, and back/parent-folder navigation affordances.
-   Added a new `WALLET` commitment and Agents Server wallet infrastructure: agents can now persist credential records (`ACCESS_TOKEN`, `USERNAME_PASSWORD`, `SESSION_COOKIE`) through wallet tools (`retrieve/store/update/delete/request`), `USE PROJECT` now expects GitHub credentials from wallet scope (agent-first, then global) instead of browser-local token storage, missing project credentials emit a structured wallet request that opens an in-chat credential popup, and a new System page (`/system/user-wallet`) plus API routes (`/api/user-wallet`) were added with a dedicated `UserWallet` database migration/table.
-   Added built-in Google Analytics (gtag.js) and Smartsapp workspace integrations: new metadata keys drive measurement/workspace configuration, `/admin/custom-js` now exposes an analytics section with toggles for default tracking behavior, and the root layout injects the generated snippets alongside any stored custom JavaScript so admins can enable instrumentation without hand-coding scripts.
-   Reworked Agents Server visibility controls so agent cards, context menus, and folder context menus open a dedicated “Update visibility” modal that lists PRIVATE / UNLISTED / PUBLIC, replacing the old “Make public”/”Make private” toggles and always letting admins pick any of the three states before hitting the API.
-   Added the `IS_EMBEDDING_ALLOWED` metadata toggle (defaulting to `true`), the `/agents/:agentName/iframe` embedding page, and middleware headers that honor the toggle so the iframe route is protected when embedding is disabled; the Website Integration card now shows a copyable iframe snippet and live preview whenever the flag permits embedding.
-   Enabled file uploads from the agent profile page whenever chat attachments are allowed by the server (metadata flag driven), reusing the shared upload handler so the profile preview matches the chat experience.
-   Fixed intermittent Agents Server Book editor syntax highlighting loss after rerender/remount on the same loaded page: Book Monaco language setup is now initialized before editor mount and registered idempotently per Monaco instance (without per-editor teardown), preventing the tokenizer/provider race that could leave subsequent renders unhighlighted.
-   Refined TEAM commitment rendering and pseudo-user naming across core + Agents Server: system message sections now keep markdown H2 headings (`## Language`, `## Teammates`) instead of flattening them away, TEAM tool schemas no longer expose teammate URLs or redundant “Use when …” text, teammate tool names are now human-readable (`team_chat_<normalized_name>_<hash>`), `{User}` teammates are now deterministically pseudonymized to English full names seeded from TEAM instructions, and pseudo-agent canonical URLs were moved from `pseudo-agent.invalid` to `pseudo-agent.promptbook` while keeping resolver compatibility.
-   Added Agents Server UI localization with pluggable language packs: introduced metadata `SERVER_LANGUAGE` (default `en`) as the server default, added built-in English/Czech packs, wired a shared language provider with cookie/local override support, localized shared header/search/control-panel/login/dialog strings, and added a new Language switcher into the Control panel next to existing global preferences.
-   Enhanced Agents Server usage analytics with a selectable primary metric (`Cost`, `Agent duration`, `Estimated human time`): `/api/usage` now aggregates `humanDuration` using the existing core `usageToWorktime` estimator from chat-history usage payloads, and `/admin/usage` now lets admins switch the dashboard (summary cards, timeline, breakdown bars, and tables) between all three metrics without duplicating estimation logic.
-   Added a metadata flag `IS_CORE_SERVER_HIDDEN` (defaults to `false`) so administrators can hide the core federated server from the homepage federated lists, header/server-selector dropdown, search provider results, and footer links while keeping the server live for direct references and agent routing.
-   Fixed Agents Server Book editor agent-reference highlighting so all equivalent notations now share one reference-token pipeline in `FROM`/`IMPORT`/`IMPORTS`/`TEAM` blocks: `{a}`, `{a a}`, `@b`, `https://example.com/c`, and `{https://example.com/d}` are now highlighted consistently and resolved as links, while non-reference commitments keep regular parameter highlighting.
-   Improved Agents Server SEO for agent profiles: `/sitemap.xml` now includes only non-deleted `PUBLIC` agent profile URLs with `lastmod`, visibility filtering for sitemap/federated `/api/agents` is now shared through one DRY utility, `robots.txt` now disallows non-index routes (admin/API/system and non-profile agent subpages), agent metadata now sets visibility-aware indexing (`noindex,nofollow` for `PRIVATE`/`UNLISTED`) with canonical/OG/Twitter URL-image fields, and public agent profile pages now emit JSON-LD structured data (`ProfilePage` + `SoftwareApplication`).
-   Added three-state Agents Server visibility (`PRIVATE` / `UNLISTED` / `PUBLIC`) with a DB migration: agent visibility validation and schema types now support `UNLISTED`, agent context menus can switch to all three states, folder context menus can batch-apply visibility across entire folder subtrees, and new-agent creation now uses metadata-driven `DEFAULT_VISIBILITY` (default `UNLISTED`, with legacy `DEFAULT_AGENT_VISIBILITY` migration fallback).
-   Added global custom CSS support for Agents Server: introduced `CustomStylesheet` database table + migration, wired root layout to inject saved CSS on every page, added reusable chat styling hooks (`.agent-response`, `.user-message`, and related classes) sourced from one shared class-name registry, and created a new admin editor at `/admin/custom-css` with a prefilled template and selector reference.
-   Expanded the custom CSS admin flow with Monaco editing, unsaved-change guarding, per-file download, and multi-file CRUD so admins can organize CSS rules across several stitched stylesheets; `/api/custom-css` now lists/saves/deletes named `CustomStylesheet` rows, and the root layout concatenates every saved stylesheet when injecting the CSS bundle.
-   Added global custom JavaScript support for Agents Server: introduced the `CustomJavascript` table with a migration, created `/api/custom-js` plus the `/admin/custom-js` editor with a helpful template and character-limit enforcement, linked the new page from the System menu, and injects the stored script into every page through the root layout so administrators can add integrations or helpers without editing the build.
-   Rebuilt the Custom JavaScript admin experience with Monaco for syntax-aware editing, unlimited named scripts stored via `/api/custom-js`, an unsaved-change guard before navigation/close, download + delete controls, and per-file save/reset/reload flows so admins can organize and export scripts without affecting each other.
-   Implemented a new `USE PROJECT` commitment for GitHub repositories in Agents Server and core parser/runtime flow: `USE PROJECT <repo>` now registers project tools (`project_list_files`, `project_read_file`, `project_upsert_file`, `project_delete_file`, `project_create_branch`, `project_create_pull_request`), exposes a new `project` capability chip, supports manual per-agent GitHub token entry in chat UI (stored locally in browser), passes token + allowed repositories through hidden tool runtime context, and isolates TEAM teammate calls from inherited project secrets.
-   Recorded Agents Server usage per user by storing `ChatHistory.userId` (for logged-in and anonymous cookie-based users), added a migration with index/foreign-key support, and extended `/api/usage` plus the admin Usage dashboard with per-user analytics.
-   Implemented `USE POPUP` commitment: agents can now request to open a popup window with a specific website (e.g. for social media sharing), including a specialized `open_popup` tool, parser support, and a dedicated modal view in Agents Server chat that allows users to manually open the requested URL when the agent is running server-side.
-   Implemented file security checks for uploaded files in Agents Server: added an abstract `FileSecurityChecker` interface with VirusTotal as the first provider, integrated it into the file upload completion webhook, and added a `securityResult` field to the `File` table to track scan results (status, confidence, malicious/suspicious counts, and full report links).
-   Allowed duplicate agent names in Agents Server: agents can now share the same name (derived from the first line of the source), with name-collision diagnostics (red underlining) warning when a name is already used; name-based resolution now always picks the oldest agent so subsequent ones remain referencable by their permanent ID, and internal foreign keys (`ChatHistory`, `ChatFeedback`) were migrated from `agentName` to `permanentId` to support non-unique names.
-   Updated `scripts/run-codex-prompts` Gemini runner so `--agent gemini` now requires explicit `--model <name>` (with `--model default` support), matching OpenAI Codex model-selection behavior and wiring the selected model through execution metadata.
-   Ensured `scripts/run-codex-prompts` commits always run as the configurable coding agent identity (configured via `CODING_AGENT_GIT_NAME`, `CODING_AGENT_GIT_EMAIL`, and `CODING_AGENT_GIT_SIGNING_KEY`) so commits are authored and GPG-signed by the agent instead of the primary user.
-   Improved self-learning JSON-mode context so when OpenAI-compatible `response_format` uses `json_schema`, the latest agent answer is now preserved as a formatted `json` code block (including pretty-print when valid JSON), helping teacher-based learning keep structured-output interactions clear.
-   Auto-generate `INITIAL MESSAGE` during self-learning if it's missing: when an open agent has no initial message defined, the teacher agent is now instructed to generate a welcoming and informative one based on the agent's capabilities and source, including quick-start options to help users begin the conversation.
-   Enhanced self-learning samples to include JSON schema information when `response_format` of type `json_schema` is requested through the OpenAI Compatible API, so the agent learns about structured output requirements.
-   Fixed Agents Server OpenAI-compatible structured responses so shorthand `response_format` JSON schemas (as shown in the integration samples) are normalized for AgentKit, ensuring schema constraints are enforced.
-   Added a “More” entry to the Agents Server agent view breadcrumb so all agent context-menu actions are accessible from the navigation hierarchy, and removed redundant back arrows from agent subpages.
-   Unified the Agents Server OpenAI Compatible integration samples into response-format tabs with fully copyable SDK snippets, keeping simple text and JSON schema options in one place and refreshing the JSON schema example.
-   Expanded the Agents Server folder icon picker with a More icons option in the edit dialog so folders can choose from a much larger icon set.
-   Added a JSON-schema `response_format` sample to the Agents Server OpenAI Compatible integration card so the docs show how to request structured replies and explain that Promptbook validates those responses before accepting them.
-   Fixed the Agents Server agent context menu Usage Analytics link so it now filters by the derived agent name and adds a `timeframe=30d` query, matching how `/admin/usage` interprets scope filters.
-   Fixed the Agents Server header search layout so the desktop search input now lives inside the centered navigation row, keeping it responsive and preventing it from overlapping the menu on narrower large-screen widths.
-   Added pseudo-agent support for Agents Server compact references: `{Void}` now works as explicit no-parent inheritance (`FROM {Void}`) while keeping legacy void aliases compatible, `{User}`/`@User` now resolve as TEAM-only pseudo teammates (case-insensitive), TEAM runtime now returns dedicated pseudo-agent tool results for `{User}`/`{Void}`, unresolved-reference diagnostics skip valid pseudo references, and Agent chat now auto-opens a one-message modal reply flow when a TEAM tool talks to `{User}`.
-   Added dedicated pseudo-agent profile pages at `/agents/user` and `/agents/void`, routing case-insensitive pseudo names to canonical documentation, surfacing each pseudo agent's summary, aliases, and usage guidance so visitors can understand how to reference {User}/{Void} without needing a stored agent.
-   Added `{Null}` as an alias of `{Void}` so book authors can use `FROM {Null}` (or `{Null}` anywhere a pseudo-agent is accepted) while keeping the same DRY runtime handling as `{Void}`.
-   Added new `USE PRIVACY` commitment with `turn_privacy_on` tool support: agents can now explicitly request privacy mode during chat, Agents Server shows a confirmation modal before enabling it, and confirmed activation reuses the existing private-mode behavior (no chat/memory/self-learning persistence) while keeping future encryption work out of current claims.
-   Added admin usage analytics in Agents Server: new `/admin/usage` now visualizes call volume with timeline graphs and breakdowns, supports granular filters by agent/folder/server scope, timeframe, call type, and actor type, surfaces API key + user-agent detail tables, and is linked from both the System admin menu and each agent context menu; usage data stays DRY by reusing `ChatHistory` records from the shared recorder (extended with `actorType`) plus a new migration for analytics-oriented chat-history indexes.
-   Added support for multiple agents in one Agents Server book: sources can now define embedded teammate agents in `---`-separated sections, compact references like `{Copywriter}`/`@Copywriter` resolve to book-scoped local agent routes, and chat/profile/book/model-requirements/system-message/OpenAI-compatible flows now resolve those embedded agents while keeping persistence and self-learning bound to the parent agent record.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat file attachments so the agent now receives inline file content context (not just filename/type/URL metadata): attachment handling now reuses a shared DRY resolver that keeps URL metadata, safely inlines text-like file contents with size/timeout limits, blocks private-network URLs, and falls back gracefully when content cannot be inlined.
-   Added a dedicated `META DOMAIN` commitment (with `DOMAIN` alias), wired parser support (`agentProfile.meta.domain` normalization), and updated Agents Server custom-host middleware routing so incoming hosts now resolve agents by `META DOMAIN` first while keeping `META LINK` matching as backward-compatible fallback.
-   Added `--dry-run` support to `scripts/run-codex-prompts/run-codex-prompts.ts` so it prints unwritten prompts (filtered by `--priority`) without executing any prompt runner or creating commits.
-   Refactored `scripts/generate-prompt-boilerplate/generate-prompt-boilerplate.ts` to use `commander` and switched its positional count argument to an explicit `--count <number>` option for clearer CLI usage.
-   Fixed intermittent missing ruled lines in Agents Server Book editor: `BookEditorMonaco` now uses a hydration-stable instance class (from `useId`) instead of a mutable render counter, so Monaco line-background styles always attach to the correct editor instance after SSR/client hydration.
-   Improved `<BookEditor/>` paste handling so plain text still pastes normally, while rich clipboard payloads (images/files and rich document formats like HTML/RTF) now switch to the same file-upload flow used by drag-and-drop/upload buttons, keeping upload behavior DRY and consistent in Agents Server.
-   Fixed intermittent forced auto-scroll in Agents Server chat: removed visibility-based auto-scroll re-enabling that could fight manual scrolling, and hardened shared chat auto-scroll logic so user scroll-up state immediately wins while auto-scroll only triggers when new content arrives and the user was already at the bottom.
-   Enabled true manual stop for Agents Server chat streaming: clicking Stop now propagates `AbortSignal` end-to-end (UI -> `/agents/[agentName]/api/chat` -> Agent -> AgentKit run), stream writes now shut down safely on client disconnect, and cancelled runs no longer continue emitting tokens after the user stops.
-   Fixed unit-test stability for unresolved agent references and chat component imports: Jest now mocks stylesheet modules globally (so `<LlmChat/>` tests no longer attempt to parse `.module.css` as code), and the unresolved-reference diagnostics test now correctly expects missing references from `FROM`, `TEAM`, and `IMPORT` compact tokens.
-   Improved Agents Server Book editor save-failure UX: autosave now tracks the last server-confirmed revision, keeps failed saves visible with a retry action, and blocks leaving the Book page (reload/close/in-app navigation/back) until the current source is confirmed saved on the server.
-   Added customizable folder appearance in Agents Server: folders now store `icon` + `color` metadata (with a new `AgentFolder` migration), the folder create/edit flow uses one shared dialog for name/icon/color, and folder visuals are now rendered consistently in homepage folder cards (including recycle bin) and the header folder hierarchy.
-   Expanded the folder icon picker so agents can choose calendar, chart line, crown, heart, palette, rocket, star, and sun glyphs in addition to the existing set, giving folders more visual distinction in the navigation and cards.
-   Fixed Agents Server header menu usability across mouse and touch: hierarchy/docs/system/profile dropdowns now use shared delayed-close behavior to prevent premature hover closes, nested desktop submenu panels now keep the parent menu alive while crossing into flyouts, touch/coarse-pointer devices can expand nested submenu branches via tap (including agent folder hierarchies), and menu panel/item styling was polished for clearer depth and hit targets.
-   Extended `KNOWLEDGE` URL handling in Agents Server/OpenAI vector-store ingestion so webpage sources (`text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml`) are now shallowly scraped to markdown before upload, enabling `KNOWLEDGE https://...` website references (not only documents/files), while still keeping document-like URLs (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`, etc.) on the existing direct-ingestion path.
-   Added expandable agent profile descriptions in the Agents Server by trimming long bios with the new shared `shortenText` helper, toggling extra text with a Show more/Show less control, and extending the `line-clamp` utilities so the hero view stays visually balanced.
-   Prevented the Agents Server chat from jumping to the bottom whenever the user scrolls up: the shared `useChatAutoScroll` hook now tracks manual scrolling so auto-scroll stays disabled until the user scrolls back or hits the scroll-to-bottom indicator, letting visitors read earlier messages without being hijacked.
-   Fixed Agents Server agent-profile inheritance so `FROM` now correctly propagates all `META` fields and `INITIAL MESSAGE` (with child overrides preserved): profile loading was refactored to a shared inherited-profile resolver reused by server-rendered profile consumers and `/api/profile`, removing the previous partial/manual inheritance path that missed remote parents.
-   Hid the Documentation and System dropdowns from the Agents Server header for anonymous visitors so guests only see the agent navigation, control panel, and login prompt.
-   Added a dedicated folder context menu in Agents Server list view (right-click on folder cards) with only folder-relevant actions (`Open Folder`, `Rename Folder`, `Delete Folder`), and refactored shared menu panel/positioning utilities so folder and agent context menus reuse the same DRY infrastructure.
-   Fixed agent and folder creation so duplicate-name conflicts now surface friendly errors: Supabase constraint violations are translated via a shared helper (returning `ConflictError`), the `/api/agent-folders` POST/PATCH endpoints return 409 responses, and the header/add-agent workflows show alerts instead of hanging when a duplicate name is detected.
-   Fixed Agents Server streaming chat so the user can keep scrolling while tokens arrive instead of having the viewport locked to the bottom; the shared `<Chat/>` component now toggles the auto-scroll hook around streaming assistant content.
-   Allowed optional guidance to follow the `OPEN` commitment, taught the teacher agent to read that guidance, and now include it in the self-learning prompt so authors can tell the teacher how to teach the agent alongside the existing openness metadata.
-   Added a metadata flag `IS_EXPERIMENTAL_PWA_APP_ENABLED` (defaults to `true`) so administrators can toggle whether the "Install Agent as App" action appears inside agent context menus, hiding the prompt when the experiment is disabled.
-   Updated Agents Server chat tool-call streaming so tool-call chips now appear while the assistant message is still streaming (not only after completion), with a shared DRY tool-call stream emitter for both ongoing and final snapshots plus unified chip-label logic used by ongoing and completed chips.
-   Added a new `MESSAGE SUFFIX` commitment with multiline support, wired it into commitment registry/parsing (`parseAgentSource.meta.messageSuffix`), and implemented DRY Agents Server runtime handling that appends the suffix to every assistant reply in native chat plus OpenAI/OpenRouter compatibility modes, including emulated streaming of the suffix chunks so it appears progressively in streamed responses.
-   Added a new `META DISCLAIMER` commitment with multiline Markdown support, wired parser/registry support in core, and implemented Agents Server disclaimer enforcement end-to-end: users must acknowledge the disclaimer before chat/voice requests proceed, agreement is persisted per user+agent in `UserData`, and chat surfaces now show a blocking pre-chat disclaimer modal with an explicit `I Agree` action.
-   Implemented global server search in Agents Server with a pluggable provider architecture (agents profile+book, federated-agent profiles, folders, conversations, documentation, metadata, users, messages/files/images, and navigation links), added the new `/api/search` aggregated endpoint, and integrated a debounced header search UX (desktop + mobile) with grouped icon-based results, contextual snippets, and direct entity links.
-   Enhanced the search experience by wiring `/search` to a paged, filterable view, polishing the header dropdown spinner/keyboard behavior, surfacing an explicit “view all results” entry, and returning total/offset metadata from `/api/search` so pagination knows the full count.
-   Fixed Agents Server header submenu usability across hierarchy and menu dropdowns: the desktop hierarchy now opens by hover (including agent-view crumbs), mobile parent items now toggle nested subitems with clear indentation, and both hierarchy/menu mobile rendering now reuse one shared DRY recursive submenu renderer.
-   Kept the Documentation and System dropdown panels open while hovering by wiring shared hover/blur timers in `apps/agents-server/src/components/Header/Header.tsx`, letting users move the cursor from the trigger into the panel without an immediate close.
-   Improved Agents Server chat switching UX by removing route-refresh navigation during in-page chat changes (URL now updates via history state), adding DRY chat activation/caching flow for instant revisits, delaying switch overlays to avoid flicker, and wiring the in-chat `New chat` action to create a fresh chat entry instead of resetting/mutating the current conversation.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat-history recording for canonicalized agent routes by resolving `agentName` from either route `agentName` or `permanentId` before inserts, so `ChatHistory` writes no longer fail with `ChatHistory_agentName_fkey` violations; also reused the same resolver in feedback handling to keep agent-identifier resolution DRY across endpoints.
-   Fixed RemoteAgent streaming tool-call parsing for large/split `{"toolCalls":...}` frames: chunk-fragmented tool payload lines are now buffered and parsed once complete, preventing raw JSON blobs from leaking into assistant message text and preserving tool-call chips in Agents Server chat.
-   Scoped Agents Server client-version enforcement to frontend browser traffic only, so OpenAI/OpenRouter compatibility routes (and other API-key/API requests) no longer require the latest Promptbook client while the frontend refresh-mismatch protection remains in place.
-   Fixed the Agents Server anonymous profile/chat pages in private windows by stopping render-time anonymous cookie writes (`ensureChatHistoryIdentity` now only checks availability); anonymous identity cookie creation remains in Route Handlers where Next.js allows cookie mutation.
-   Fixed Agents Server menu stacking order: agent context menus now render above agent cards in the homepage folder/list view, while the mobile hamburger menu remains above agent-related overlays (including the profile context-menu trigger layer).
-   Refined the Agents Server desktop collapsed My chats sidebar to prevent overflow by switching to compact avatar-first chat cards, keeping timestamps readable in the narrow rail, and reusing one shared chat-item content resolver for both collapsed and expanded sidebar layouts.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat-history persistence by introducing a shared DRY recorder for chat, voice, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints that now consistently captures message hashes/telemetry, logs insert failures instead of silently swallowing them, and falls back when optional `ChatHistory` columns are missing; also added an idempotent migration to ensure `ChatHistory.source` and `ChatHistory.apiKey` exist with the expected `source` constraint.
-   Added a new `USE USER LOCATION` commitment with a `get_user_location` tool, wired hidden runtime-context support for browser geolocation, and integrated Agents Server on-demand location prompting so the browser requests location only after the agent explicitly asks for it.
-   Added dual Agents Server application-error variants (`simple` and `advanced`) with shared DRY rendering helpers, and wired the Next.js app error boundary to report every captured failure to Sentry through the new `/api/error-reports/application` forwarding endpoint.
-   Fixed Agents Server TypeScript compatibility regressions across header submenu timers, homepage graph/list layout typing, anonymous user cookie/header helpers (Next async runtime APIs), user-memory identity fallback typing, metadata default lookup typing, and `<LlmChat/>` prompt parameter typing so `npx tsc --noEmit` no longer fails on these strict type errors.
-   Enabled the Agents Server desktop chat area to stay interactive while the sidebar remains open by keeping the backdrop overlay visual-only (pointer-events disabled), eliminating the auto-close-on-click behavior that previously closed the panel, while leaving the mobile overlay dismiss flow unchanged.
-   Added a private mode toggle to the control panel so chats, memories, and self-learning stay local when it’s enabled, the My chats preview displays a dedicated private indicator, and the server chat/voice/OpenAI-compatible APIs plus the user-chat/user-memory endpoints skip writing any data while the private-mode cookie is present.
-   Added a Control Panel self-learning toggle so administrators can pause the book-editing flow for their agents while continuing to save chats and memories, and wired `selfLearningEnabled` prompt parameters through RemoteAgent so the server skips the automatic self-learning hook whenever the switch is off.
-   Added user profile avatars to the Agents Server: users can now set a `profileImageUrl` via the new System → Profile page (backed by `/api/profile`), the header displays that image instead of the placeholder initial, and the System menu exposes the Profile link next to the existing User Memory entry.
-   Added anonymous chat persistence in the Agents Server: guests now get `anonymous-<base58>` usernames stored in cookies, the user-chat/memory services reuse the shared identity resolver, and the My chats sidebar surfaces the same list for anonymous users as it does for signed-in accounts.
-   Added a shared `textToPreviewText` helper so chat previews (history cards, quick-access shortcuts, etc.) reuse the same Markdown sanitization pipeline as voice previews while keeping the JSON storage layer DRY.
-   Fixed the Agents Server header breadcrumb so folders show the folder icon instead of a single-letter placeholder when no agent avatar is available.
-   Reduced Agents Server homepage cold-start latency by introducing a `getMetadataMap` helper so the layout, federated-server lookup, and chat-preference helpers now read their metadata in a single Supabase round-trip instead of multiple sequential queries.
-   Added a shared `SidebarToggleArrow` component for the Agents Server and anchored it to the middle of the desktop chat sidebar so the open/close affordance always reuses a single arrow implementation.
-   Centered the desktop chat sidebar toggle over the chat’s left panel so the open/closing arrow now lives inline with the main chat surface while keeping the shared arrow component intact.
-   Fixed the Agents Server header Documentation and System dropdown subitems so nested panels float outside the scrollable dropdown instead of getting clipped behind the first-level container.
-   Centered the Agents Server desktop header navigation so the middle menu items stay locked in the visual center of the panel regardless of how wide the surrounding sections become.
-   Added a build-time prerender step for the Agents Server homepage (`/`) so `npm run build`/`npm run test-build` spin up the production server, capture the rendered HTML, and save it under `.next/prerendered/home.html`.
-   Improved the Agents Server desktop collapsed chat strip so each chat now shows a short title/preview/timestamp badge (and the strip slightly widens) while the mobile sidebar return path stays unchanged.
-   Fixed the Agents Server mobile chat history edge handle so tapping the floating arrow reuses the same sidebar list as desktop, always renders the readable title/preview/timestamp layout, and keeps the vertical strip hidden until the mobile overlay is opened.
-   Removed the redundant desktop chat history/book headers in Agents Server so the desktop view no longer shows the extra panel below the main menu while mobile layouts remain unchanged.
-   Removed the redundant `USE IMAGE GENERATION`, `USE IMAGE`, and `IMAGE GENERATOR` commitment aliases so only the working `USE IMAGE GENERATOR` commitment remains, reducing confusion for users and contributors.
-   Added CDN-friendly caching headers on the Agents Server homepage (`/`) so Vercel can pre-render that route with `s-maxage`/`stale-while-revalidate` and the first visitor no longer hits a cold SSR run.
-   Snapped the Agents Server footer to the bottom of the viewport so the layout no longer leaves the footer floating mid-page when the content is short.
-   Added a global version-mismatch experience that surfaces a friendly refresh notice, prevents the old chat-only message, and automatically reloads the page whenever the server requires a newer client release.
-   Simplified the Agents Server new-version modal so it now highlights the update, shows a focus-aware 7-second countdown, and exposes refresh/stop controls so the page reloads automatically unless the user opts out.
-   Added a custom Agents Server application error page with a branded layout, digest tracking, and proactive troubleshooting guidance for failed navigations.
-   Ensured Agents Server chat uploads now hand the generated CDN URL back to the client instead of the experimental short-link alias so attached files are accessible to agents outside the browser.
-   Improved the Agents Server chat history drawer: the left panel now slides with smoother animation, auto-closes when you tap outside, sits atop the header instead of being cropped, and exposes a mobile edge handle plus a minimal desktop strip so chats stay accessible without the extra top bar.
-   Added in-chat map rendering for GeoJSON features so agent replies that include \`\`\`geojson\`\`\` blocks now render a Leaflet map inside the bubble that zooms to the provided feature/collection.
-   Fixed the chat GeoJSON renderer so Leaflet overlays draw their features as soon as they're ready instead of showing a bare map for several seconds by invalidating the map size once the layer is initialized.
-   Expanded the chat GeoJSON map bubble so it stretches wider on desktop and mobile and added a control that opens the same Leaflet rendering in a responsive modal for a closer look.
-   Polished chat GeoJSON feature rendering so generated points of interest show glowing markers with tooltip initials, lines and polygons gain richer strokes/fills, and hover highlights keep each feature visually focused.
-   Hid streaming-only rich-feature markup (maps, inline image prompts, math/code fences, etc.) so the chat keeps streaming the human-readable text while the feature materializes instead of dumping raw GeoJSON or image prompt source, and the completed rendering appears once the assistant finishes.
-   Added placeholder widgets for streaming rich features (maps, images, inline LaTeX, etc.) so the chat now shows a friendly loading surface while the agent is still generating each rendered element instead of leaving the bubble blank until the feature is ready.
-   Stopped `STREAM_KEEP_ALIVE` heartbeats from ever reaching `<Chat/>` by filtering them inside `RemoteAgent` so keep-alive pings stay hidden while preserving the underlying connection health signals.
-   Ensured the Agents Server chat reset option now just opens a new chat instead of re-inserting the failed message, so the “Reset” button clears the conversation without duplicating the input.
-   Updated Agents Server `/admin/api-tokens` token rows to use the shared `<SecretInput/>` control, so API tokens are masked by default and can be toggled visible/hidden with the eye icon while keeping copy-to-clipboard inline.
-   Added `--priority <minimum-priority>` to `scripts/run-codex-prompts` so coding tasks can be filtered by priority threshold (default `0` keeps current behavior), and updated runner stats to show skipped runnable tasks as `Priority <N` while preserving `--agent`/`--model` behavior.
-   Fixed `USE IMAGE GENERATOR` to follow notation-only behavior: agents are now instructed to output `![alt](?image-prompt=...)` placeholders (instead of calling a generation tool), while the UI keeps generating images from that notation.
-   Refactored Agents Server image generation cache/lock flow into a shared `ensureGeneratedImage` utility and reused it in both `/api/images/[filename]` and default-agent-avatar generation, so lock waiting, stale-lock cleanup, and cache-first behavior are DRY and consistent.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat action button fading so `New chat` / `Save` are no longer stuck dimmed: overlap detection now checks the real message content block instead of the full-width message row, keeping fade only when buttons truly cover message content.
-   Redesigned the Agents Server header navigation into a hierarchy-first flow (`Server > Agent > Profile/Chat/Book`), moved server branding to the left edge, moved Users under `System`, renamed menu entries to `Landing page` and `Version info`, and removed the duplicated in-page `Chat/Source` switcher buttons from chat/book views.
-   Fixed Agents Server header folder flyout navigation so nested submenu columns are no longer clipped behind the first-level dropdown container, while keeping standard non-flyout dropdowns scrollable.
-   Fixed Agents Server profile-chat handoff with history enabled by introducing a profile-origin `newChat=1` flow: both typed messages and quick `?message=...` starts now always bootstrap a fresh chat and auto-send the message instead of occasionally landing in an existing chat without execution.
-   Fixed Book editor instant teammate creation for unresolved `TEAM` references in Agents Server: creating `Create {name}` now refreshes reference diagnostics immediately (no stale resolver cache), ignores soft-deleted duplicates when checking existing agents, updates the missing-teammate panel reliably right after creation, and encodes agent identifiers during folder lookups so newly created teammates stay in the same folder even when the current agent uses a non-canonical name.
-   Extended the Book editor missing-reference panel so every unresolved compact agent token (`@Agent`, `{Agent}`, etc., regardless of FROM, IMPORT(S), or TEAM) now appears under “Missing referenced agents” and can be resolved through the shared `/api/book/missing-agent` quick-create flow, keeping diagnostics and resolver caches refreshed once the referenced agent is created.
-   Ensured the desktop Book editor grants space for that “Missing referenced agents” panel by letting the editor column shrink (`min-w-0`) so the quick-create cards remain visible even inside the resizable book/chat split.
-   Fixed the coding-agent runner progress header so it stays pinned in a dedicated top terminal line (white background) while agent CLI output continues streaming in real time below it, and refactored the progress line calculations into a shared DRY helper.
-   Added a shared secret input component to the Agents Server so login, change-password, admin auth, user creation, and token copy panels can reuse the same visibility toggle for passwords and API keys.
-   Fixed backgrounding on small devices by adding keep-alive pings to the Agents Server chat stream and teaching RemoteAgent to ignore the heartbeat token (`STREAM_KEEP_ALIVE`), so long-running replies stay connected even if the user switches away and returns later.
-   Added visibility-aware recovery in `<LlmChat/>` so backgrounded streaming responses no longer surface a “connection error” dialog; the interrupted prompt is retried automatically when the tab becomes visible again and the previous assistant message continues streaming.
-   Fixed the remaining Samsung Internet chat overflow root cause by tightening shared `<Chat/>` width constraints (removing `100vw` sizing, applying `min-width: 0` on flex/grid boundaries, and capping bubble width by `avatar + gap` math) and stabilized emoji font loading by switching OpenMoji `@font-face` in `Chat.module.css` to local-first sources with CDN fallback.
    -### 📚 Book

-   Implemented persistent `MEMORY` commitment support in Agents Server end-to-end: `MEMORY` now registers hidden retrieve/store memory tools (with optional per-commitment instructions), stores data in the new `UserMemory` table (per user + per agent, with global-memory option), disables memory automatically for unauthenticated users and TEAM conversations, shows memory tool chips with stored/retrieved content, adds `System -> User Memory` CRUD UI for logged-in users, and wires admin (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`) memory identity with automatic DB-user linking.
-   Expanded the Agents Server memory experience by soft-deleting records (`deletedAt` column + migration), preferring agent-scoped entries by default, and teaching the MEMORY commitment to use new `update_user_memory` / `delete_user_memory` tools so each agent can edit or retire its own memories (global entries stay optional and shared).
-   Added per-user, per-agent chat history in Agents Server with a new `UserChat` table and migration: standalone chat now supports creating/resuming/deleting chats, stores full chat message arrays as JSON, keeps `?chat=<id>` URL routing (including fallback to most-recent chat when missing/invalid), orders chats by latest activity, creates a fresh chat when starting from the profile page, and keeps history disabled for unauthenticated users while preserving existing global `ChatHistory` logging.
-   Polished the Agents Server chat HTML export so the downloaded file mirrors the live chat experience with a hero banner, stat grid, bubble cards, avatars, attachments/citations, and embedded illustrations, making exports shareable instead of the previous bare layout.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat PDF downloads so the Save menu now produces a valid file (powered by a reusable jsPDF exporter that reuses the text/plain renderer) instead of the previous placeholder string, delivering real downloads in every chat.
-   Enhanced the Agents Server chat PDF export so the saved file preserves the agent background, colored message bubbles, avatars, and a branded print header, letting the exported chat mirror the live conversation instead of looking like plain text.
-   Added a System → About entry that opens the new `/admin/about` page so admins can view shared Promptbook, system, and deployment version cards without hunting through the menu.
-   Moved the Models navigation link into System → Models in the Agents Server header so admins keep a single System dropdown while maintaining quick access to model management.
-   When admins set up or update passwords in Agents Server (setup flow plus the admin users/change-password screens), weak passwords now surface the validation message (e.g., minimum length/format) instead of a generic “Internal server error”, so it’s clear what to fix before retrying.
-   Added a `BookEditable` helper to keep `KNOWLEDGE` insertions (from uploads) positioned just before the `CLOSED` commitment instead of at the very end of the book.
-   Enabled clickable agent references in the Book editor: `@agent`, `{agent name}`, `{agentId}`, `https://.../agents/...`, and `{https://.../agents/...}` now share one highlight style and open the referenced agent via Ctrl/Cmd+Click.
-   Fixed Samsung Internet rendering issues in the Agents Server by replacing `w-screen` route shells with a shared viewport-width-safe class, switching affected full-height routes to `100dvh`-based sizing, and improving font fallbacks/loading (`font-display: swap`, emoji fallback stack, and text autosize normalization) to prevent horizontal overflow and inconsistent font rendering on mobile Samsung browsers.
-   Added unresolved-reference diagnostics to the Agents Server Book editor: missing compact agent references in `FROM`, `TEAM`, and `IMPORT` commitments are now underlined red (Monaco error markers) while keeping links clickable, powered by a new shared DRY resolver-based diagnostics utility and API endpoint.
-   Added a Book editor right panel for unresolved TEAM references so admins immediately see “Team member {name} is not found. Do you want to create it?” prompts and can hit `Create {name}` to spin up a folder-aware boilerplate agent, refresh diagnostics, and resolve the teammate without leaving the editor.
-   Ensured the instant teammate creation panel always reflects the exact token (e.g., `{Lawyer}`/`@lawyer`) and re-runs diagnostics with a cache-busting refresh so the card disappears as soon as the resolver detects the freshly created agent.
-   Fixed global agent route canonicalization in Agents Server: opening `/agents/:agentId` now resolves compact references through the shared local/federated resolver, redirects names and normalized-name variants to canonical `/agents/<permanentId>`, redirects federated hits to the correct remote server URL, and returns 404 when unresolved.
-   Hardened missing referenced-agent handling across `FROM`, `IMPORT`, and `TEAM` in Agents Server: compact references that cannot be resolved are now tracked through a shared DRY resolver-issue abstraction, inheritance/import processing no longer crashes and emits visible `NOTE` warnings instead, unresolved TEAM references are shown as `(not found)` capability chips without teammate URLs, and model-requirements flows now safely degrade instead of breaking the whole agent.
-   Allowed Agents Server TEAM references to still resolve private teammates hosted on the same server by falling back to a local agent lookup when compact references report issues, so local teammates stay reachable even when their visibility is private while federated servers continue to require public agents.
-   Strengthened source citation behavior in Agents Server chat: AgentKit instructions now append a shared citation policy whenever knowledge/web tools are active, and chat post-processing now preserves parsed citations before humanization so source chips remain visible instead of being dropped.
-   Simplified Agents Server knowledge chips by trimming CDN filenames to the first 20 characters (after dropping the extension), removing any trailing `isHumanOrID`-detected IDs, and keeping the original name for the tooltip via the new `simplifyKnowledgeLabel` helper.
-   Fixed knowledge chip simplification where it previously affected only agent capability chips: chat source chips now use the same shared `simplifyKnowledgeLabel`/`isHumanOrID` utility (moved to `src/utils/knowledge`) so CDN document citations finally hide random ID suffixes and show clean 20-character labels.
-   Expanded Agents Server chat citation parsing to support simplified source markers like `【document123.doc】` in addition to full OpenAI markers like `【7:15†document123.doc】`; both now reuse a shared DRY normalization utility, resolve to the same source-chip pipeline, and keep citation links working against agent knowledge documents.
-   Fixed duplicated tool call chips (including empty first chips) in Agents Server chat by streaming only finalized tool call payloads to the client, so each invocation now renders a single correct chip while still showing distinct chips for distinct calls.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat feedback saving by resolving agent identifiers to canonical names (fixing foreign key violations) and correctly extracting the user's IP from the `x-forwarded-for` header, ensuring successful database insertion.
-   Improved the Agents Server chat feedback toast to report the actual server response (green on 201, red with the returned message on errors), and fixed its positioning to sit above the sticky header and menus with an increased z-index.
-   Enforced a client-version handshake across Agents Server chat, voice, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints: every request must now send `x-promptbook-client-version`, outdated clients get an inline update message inside the chat, and our Vercel deployment always serves the `PROMPTBOOK_ENGINE_VERSION` release.
-   Refined the Agents Server Documentation dropdown so only PERSONA, KNOWLEDGE, GOAL, TEAM, CLOSED, INITIAL MESSAGE, and USE SEARCH ENGINE stay at the top level while the remaining commitments live inside a hoverable “All” submenu, keeping the menu compact on desktop and mobile.
-   Refined the experimental Story app in Agents Server: moved it to `/experiments/story` (with legacy `/story` redirect), changed story naming to use the editor’s first line instead of a separate title field, replaced the old `actors` model with selected existing server agents, switched Story export UI to a chat-save-style Save dropdown, and nested navigation under `System -> Experiments -> Story` using the existing hover submenu pattern.

-   Added a scroll-to-bottom indicator to the Agents Server chat so the floating arrow now announces unseen replies, surfaces a new-messages badge, and keeps the action accessible even when the user scrolls away from the newest content.
-   Refined the Agents Server chat scroll-to-bottom control with a cleaner directional arrow icon and richer frosted styling (hover/focus ring, subtle motion, and badge polish) while keeping sizing and color tokens DRY through shared CSS variables.
-   Improved Agents Server chat scroll indicator UX by showing the scroll-down control only while the latest message is actually out of view (not just based on autoscroll state), and redesigned the "X new messages" badge into a centered floating pill above the arrow for clearer placement and readability.
-   Removed `backdrop-filter` from the Agents Server chat scroll-down button and its new-messages badge so transformed overlay layers no longer create ghost blur patches above the message input.

-   Removed the Agents Server desktop hamburger menu so the toggle only appears in mobile layouts where it is used.
-   Improved the Agents Server transition from agent profile chat to full chat by removing the blocking overlay, fixing promise-safe message handoff from the profile composer/quick buttons, and using a shared view-transition surface so opening `/chat` feels immediate and seamless.
-   Fixed profile chat handoff so `?message=…` now always lands in a newly created chat and immediately runs the written or quick message even when the history loader has to bootstrap another chat ID, preventing the first conversation from opening blank after the chat history rewrite.
-   Added quick-access buttons to the profile chat preview so authenticated users can continue a recent conversation while the default action still starts a new chat.
-   Added a shared `SoundSystemProvider` and moved the chat sound/vibration toggles into the new header Control Panel (desktop dropdown + mobile card), keeping the global controls near the profile menu instead of buried under the chat save menu.
-   Added the shared useUnsavedChangesGuard hook so modal closing (starting with the Agents Server create-agent dialog) confirms before discarding agent book edits and blocks tab closes until the user confirms.
-   Removed the clone button from the Agents Server directory listing cards so cloning stays available only via the agent context menu, preventing duplicate actions in both views.
-   Modernized the Agents Server default agent visuals: the default avatar prompt now asks for a cinematic, digital portrait, the icon and screenshot generators share a DRY helper for gradient-forward layouts, and the image gallery page renders in a polished card-based design that keeps the new assets front and center.
-   Refined the Agents Server default avatar prompt to generate warmer, mentor-like animated agent portraits with stronger per-agent visual distinction, business-friendly tone, color-aware styling, and explicit no-text/no-photorealism constraints.
-   Added inline metadata editing to the Agents Server admin screen so values and notes can be updated directly from each row without scrolling to the add form.
-   Fixed Agents Server metadata row editing so clicking `Edit` opens only the selected row (including default keys) by tracking edit state per metadata key instead of shared default IDs, keeping edits in place without unexpectedly expanding all default entries.
-   Fixed Agents Server inline metadata typing focus loss by moving the shared metadata value editor to a stable module-level component (instead of recreating it during each render), so the cursor now stays focused while editing values in place.
-   Ensured the agent model requirements that are sent to third-party LLMs (and the Agents Server `/api/model-requirements` response) only include low-level properties by stripping `metadata`, `notes`, `parentAgentUrl`, and `promptSuffix`, keeping internal commitments data inside Promptbook.
-   Ensured the OpenAI compatibility chat endpoints in the Agents Server forward any `response_format` payload to the underlying OpenAI/API provider by mapping it to AgentKit output types before each run so JSON schema responses are honored.
-   OpenAI compatibility mode of the agent server now respects the `response_format` parameter by correctly passing it to the AgentKit execution tools.
-   Ensured `response_format` overrides still honor JSON schema output when cached AgentKit assistants are reused by mapping the format inside `AgentLlmExecutionTools` before running the prepared agent.
-   Supported the OpenAI `tools` and `tool_choice` parameters in the Agents Server compatibility proxy so requests that rely on function/tool calling are simply forwarded to OpenAI without needing Promptbook to implement the tooling itself.
-   Fixed the Agents Server clone flow so it now prompts with a prefilled "Copy of {agent name}" name, reuses a shared dialog helper, and redirects into the freshly cloned agent instead of a missing route.
-   Fixed the Agents Server home list so the client cache re-syncs with the server-provided agent and folder data immediately after signing in, eliminating the need for a manual refresh.
-   Added explicit drag handles to the Agents Server homepage cards so touchscreens can scroll freely while drag-and-drop remains pinned to a clearly marked handle that also works for folders.
-   The error dialog when the chat fails ("Connection Issue") now has an option to reset the chat with the same message sent to a fresh chat.
-   Added the `CHAT_FAIL_MESSAGE` metadata so the Agents Server can replace the technical fallback string with a friendly failure copy, and wired the chat routes and AgentChat wrapper to read this value before passing it into `LlmChat`.
-   Ensured country flag emoji render with the OpenMoji color font across the Agents Server UI (including the chat) so flags no longer fall back to regional-indicator letters and now appear as recognizable country icons.
-   Voice dictation now honors the user's locale (Accept-Language -> speech recognition language) so Whisper stays in the speaker's language instead of forcing English, with the new language hint threaded through Agent chat, profile chat, and the voice test client.
-   Added a new metadata flag `IS_EXPERIMENTAL_VOICE_TTS_STT_ENABLED` (default `true`) so admins can disable the shared text-to-speech / speech-to-text stack separately from `IS_EXPERIMENTAL_VOICE_CALLING_ENABLED`; the profile API now returns both flags, RemoteAgent surfaces the speech availability, the Agents Server chat hides the microphone and playback controls when speech is off, and every speech endpoint (`/api/voice`, `/api/elevenlabs/tts`, `/api/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`) returns `403` whenever TTS/STT has been frozen out.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat attachments so the uploaded file metadata is forwarded to the agent prompt, keeping uploads accessible to the agent after hitting the server.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat uploads so attached files now use the shared CDN uploader and are stored on the server before the agent logs a message, preventing dropped attachments.
-   Hardened Agents Server chat attachment delivery end-to-end: chat now normalizes attachment payloads, appends a model-visible attachment URL section to the user prompt, uses short upload links for chat attachments, and makes `/api/upload` payload parsing/MIME handling resilient so valid files are no longer rejected by brittle client metadata.
-   Enabled Agents Server chat attachments to be ingested as temporary knowledge sources so each uploaded file is downloaded, indexed, and readable by the AgentKit agent (attachment-only runs skip the cached knowledge base to keep the vector store fresh while non-attachment flows still benefit from caching).
-   Added the `IS_FILE_ATTACHEMENTS_ENABLED` metadata flag (default `true`) so admins can toggle chat attachments off; when disabled, the Agents Server chat stops wiring the upload handler and hides the drag-and-drop/file button controls.
-   Show error message when the agent returns an empty message.
-   Enabled `\\(...\\)` and `\\[...\\]` LaTeX delimiters in chat markdown so inline and block formulas render with the existing KaTeX pipeline, matching `$...$`/`$$...$$` behavior and keeping the shared renderer reusable across chat/agent components.
-   Stopped KaTeX from running inside inline/fenced code in Agents Server chat so LaTeX notation remains raw when it is intentionally shown as code while still rendering normally in prose or blockquote contexts.
-   Preserved file attachments when cloning prompts for OpenAI chat so playground uploads keep their `arrayBuffer` after the OpenAI 6.18.0 upgrade.
-   Re-styled Markdown headings inside chat bubbles as card-like sections that lean on the same shared heading tokens but now add gradient glass texture, a thicker accent border, high-fidelity glow lines, and deeper drop shadows so the headings mirror the richer Agents Server card language.
-   Tuned the new heading tokens so every Markdown heading grabs its border, shadow, and text colors from the chat bubble palette, letting the card-like headers glow softly and stay in sync with the shared Agents Server design language.
-   Underlined inline links inside Agents Server chat bubbles so URLs stay recognizable now that the heading tiles use card-style backgrounds.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat avatar/bubble spacing while the agent is still thinking or streaming by making the avatar image size follow the responsive avatar container; incomplete and completed message rows now keep the same visual gap on mobile.

-   Added `scripts/verify-prompts/verify-prompts.ts`, an interactive helper that lists top-level prompts, walks through every `[ ]` section, archives resolved files under `prompts/done`, and automatically appends the requested fix prompts when work is still pending; registered the helper as a new task in `.vscode/terminals.json`.

-   Added quick chat/source pills to the Agents Server so the chat header and agent source (book) editor stay in sync; admins can now jump directly between the conversation and knowledge editor without returning to the profile page.
-   Added ElevenLabs speech playback to the chat so every bubble can be read aloud via the new `/api/elevenlabs/tts` route (guarded by the client-version handshake), complete with play/pause controls, cached audio blobs, and env-configurable voice/model defaults plus the shared `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVEN_LABS_VOICE_ID`, and `ELEVEN_LABS_MODEL_ID` settings.
-   Added the `textToSpeechText` helper so the Agents Server voice chat sanitizes Markdown, URLs, citations, and formatting before calling both the OpenAI TTS route and the ElevenLabs `/tts` endpoint, keeping spoken replies clean while reusing one DRY implementation.
-   Added a `META VOICE` commitment so agent sources can pin their ElevenLabs voice ID, threaded the metadata into RemoteAgent/Agents Server profiles, and taught `/api/elevenlabs/tts` plus the chat playback helper to use the agent-specific ID when requesting speech audio.

### 📚 Book

-   Added flexible agent referencing for FROM, IMPORT, and TEAM so you can write {Activation code agent}, @Superagent, agentId, or even {https://foo} instead of raw URLs; the agents server now resolves these tokens by searching local and federated agents through a shared resolver.

-   Added the shared `AgentReferenceResolver` option to the core engine (and the new `CreateAgentModelRequirementsOptions` type) so Sender, IMPORT, and TEAM references are rewritten before applying commitments, and wired the resolver through the Agents Server APIs and cache managers to keep assistant creation and metadata in sync while a regression test protects the hook.
-   Reworked inline `KNOWLEDGE` so inline text pieces are converted into temporary CDN files before being added to `AgentModelRequirements.knowledgeSources`, introduced the uploader hook behind `CreateAgentModelRequirementsOptions`, and passed the shared uploader through all Agents Server cache/handler paths so inline knowledge behaves exactly like referenced files in vector stores and execution while still falling back to data URLs when the uploader is not supplied.
-   Updated `KNOWLEDGE` commitment parsing so free-form text can embed any number of URLs: all referenced URLs are now extracted into `knowledgeSources` for scraping/vector-store ingestion, while meaningful surrounding prose is still preserved as inline knowledge; also unified URL extraction through a shared helper reused by both commitment application and `parseAgentSource` (Agents Server profile/citation metadata).
-   Fixed Agents Server teammate chat chips for compact TEAM references (`{Agent}` / `@Agent`) by resolving TEAM capabilities through the shared agent reference resolver in the profile API, so teammate communication chips and modal conversations render again after the agent-referencing upgrade.

-   Leveraged Vibrations API in the chat to provide haptic feedback in sync with the sound system.
-   Added metadata keys `DEFAULT_IS_SOUNDS_ON` and `DEFAULT_IS_VIBRATION_ON` so admins can configure the default chat feedback state, and surfaced independent sound/haptic toggles in the save menu (`ChatSoundToggle` + `ChatVibrationToggle`) that respect those defaults while persisting the user's choice.
-   Reworked the save menu controls into the new `ChatSoundAndVibrationPanel`, keeping the two switches inside a single polished card with lucide icons and dense status badges so the sound and haptic toggles stay intuitive yet inconspicuous.
-   Allow to make agent public / private agent from its context menu on the Agent profile page / right click of the agent.
-   Organized the Agents dropdown menu in the Agents Server header by folders: folders now link to their scoped homepage view, agents are indented under their folder hierarchy, and ordering follows the saved folder/agent sort order.
-   Made the Agents dropdown menu render folder branches in hover-expanding columns so large folder/agent trees stay manageable without overwhelming a single list.

-   Migrated Promptbook Agents to OpenAI AgentKit: added AgentKit execution tools with shared vector store handling, updated Agents Server caching to store AgentKit vector stores in `preparedExternals`, and refreshed playground samples.
-   Cached OpenAI vector stores in a new `AgentExternals` table keyed by knowledge source content hashes, removing `Agent.preparedExternals` from the Agents Server schema.
-   Added `note` metadata to Agents Server `AgentExternals` entries so cached vector stores record the creating agent and stored files.
-   Fixed OpenAI AgentKit knowledge ingestion by using the stable vector stores API and updated file batch calls for the current OpenAI SDK.
-   Removed invalid Keep-Alive request headers for OpenAI-compatible clients to fix AgentKit chat failures in Agents Server.
-   Replaced OpenAI assistant knowledge ingestion timing magic numbers with named constants to satisfy lint rules.
-   Reported word-based usage for OpenAI/OpenRouter compatibility chat completions in Agents Server, including native Promptbook usage details.
-   Fixed the Agents Server OpenAI compatibility handler so `usage.details` now includes real word/character/line/paragraph/page counts for both input and output by merging native usage with computed text statistics.
-   Wired Agents Server chat to reuse cached OpenAI Assistants (external preparation), building assistants from full model requirements and bumping the cache key version to avoid stale knowledge bases.
-   Added a script to batch delete OpenAI assistants with pagination and a confirmation prompt.
-   Fixed the OpenAI assistants cleanup script to auto-paginate through all pages before deletion.
-   Added a script to batch delete OpenAI assistants, vector stores, and files with a single confirmation prompt.

-   Added root nonce test files `nonce-foo-1.txt` and `nonce-bar-1.txt` for coding agent verification.
-   Regenerated the Agents Server Supabase subset schema for `Agent` and `AgentHistory` to stay aligned with the canonical database schema.
-   Regenerated the Agents Server Supabase schema types from migrations, aligning ChatHistory and File table fields.
-   Added Agents Server folder organization with nested folders, drag-and-drop ordering, URL folder paths, and recycle bin support for folders.
-   Fixed Agents Server folder creation at the root level by querying `parentId` with null-aware filters to avoid bigint "null" errors.
-   Replaced blocking browser `alert`, `prompt`, and `confirm` calls in Agents Server with queued async dialogs rendered via a global provider.
-   Added a queued `showLoginDialog` helper and wired the header login controls into the same async dialog queue so the login pop-up now uses the shared non-blocking modal shell and respects cancelation/ordering rules.
-   Refined the agent avatar hover tooltip in Agents Server chat with a cleaner card, profile link, and resilient image fallback.
-   Fixed agent avatar resolution to prefer META IMAGE across chat popups and UI cards, with consistent placeholder fallbacks for local and federated agents.
-   Added a global route loading indicator in Agents Server to show feedback during link navigation.
-   Enhanced refactor-candidate prompt generation with richer guidance, clearer file linking, and reason-aware context.
-   Added shared prompt emoji tag selection so generated refactor and boilerplate prompts use fresh unique `[✨]` tags across the repo.
-   Added a refactor-candidate scanner script that flags oversized or entity-heavy source files and generates per-file refactor prompts in `prompts`.
-   Scoped the refactor-candidate scanner to `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx` files while skipping hidden directories, `node_modules`, and `packages/`.
-   Leveraged `spaceTrim` across the repository for better readability and maintainability of multiline strings and string joins.
-   Simplified the Agents Server home page to focus on agents, moved the previous dashboard to `/dashboard`, and linked it from the System menu.
-   Made Agents Server home list cards more compact and file-like, including smaller capability chips.
-   Enhanced Agents Server home agent cards with dynamic, color-based backgrounds and subtle noise effects for a more professional look.
-   Improved Agents Server list drag-and-drop with live reordering, drag overlays, and clearer drop targets for agents and folders.
-   Reduced accidental drag activations on touchscreens in the Agents Server home list by adding touch-specific activation delays.
-   Added a parent folder card in Agents Server list view to quickly navigate up and drag agents or folders to the parent.
-   Created new agents inside the active folder when adding from a subfolder view in the Agents Server home list.
-   Added a configurable Markdown message (via metadata) shown above the agents list on the Agents Server homepage.
-   Added `AGENT_NAMING` metadata to customize agent terminology (singular/plural) across the Agents Server UI with casing-aware replacements.
-   Added `THINKING_MESSAGES` metadata so admins can set slash-delimited placeholder variants (default `Thinking... / Searching for information... / Sorting information...`) that rotate while an agent is composing a reply.
-   Agents Server chat now samples a random `THINKING_MESSAGES` variant each time an agent starts thinking and then switches to another random variant every 1-5 seconds until the agent finish streaming its reply, giving the thinking placeholder a lively, ever-changing feel.
-   Scoped the Agents Server homepage message and federated agents to the root view, and updated folder headings to show the folder name with per-folder agent counts.
-   Added a shared Agents Server context menu with right-click support on agent cards, plus rename actions reused on agent profile pages.
-   Added an "Open Folder" action to the Agents Server agent context menu (profile menu and right click) to jump to the agent's folder for management.
-   Added a chat preparation chip in Agents Server to signal when GPT assistants are being created before the first response.
-   Added `[🤰]`-tagged assistant preparation logging (cache lookup, model requirement timing, assistant create/update, vector store progress) and surfaced preparation phases on the "Preparing agent" chip.
-   Added per-knowledge-source download timeouts plus richer logging during OpenAI assistant knowledge ingestion to pinpoint stalls.
-   Added detailed OpenAI vector store upload progress logs (file uploads, batch polling, timeouts) to prevent assistant preparation from hanging silently.
-   Added vector store batch diagnostics (file type summary, per-file status samples, vector store status) and guarded invalid batch IDs during assistant knowledge ingestion.
-   Fixed OpenAI vector store batch polling to log expected vs. returned batch IDs and cancel using the created batch ID when mismatches occur.
-   Fixed vector store file batch polling to use real batch IDs (vsfb\_\*) and improved diagnostics to map uploaded file IDs to vector store file IDs.
-   Scoped the "Preparing agent: Creating assistant" chip in Agents Server to cache misses by emitting it only when a new assistant is created from cache lookup.
-   Enhanced OpenAI vector store upload robustness and logging:
    -   Added explicit file extension logging during knowledge ingestion to identify potential bottlenecks.
    -   Implemented early "stalled" diagnostics if vector store batches remain in progress for more than 30 seconds without change.
    -   Added specific warnings for PDF files which are known to cause ingestion delays.
    -   Synced comprehensive polling and diagnostic logic between Assistants and Responses APIs.
-   Added `shouldContinueOnVectorStoreStall` option to OpenAI assistant tools (default `true`) to prevent stuck PDF ingestion from blocking agent preparation.
-   Fixed Vector Store ID vs. File Batch ID mismatch handling in OpenAI polling logic.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat to always return a fallback message when the model produces an empty response, including streaming and OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
-   Fixed Agents Server Book editor multi-file uploads by debouncing editor updates, tracking placeholders safely, and adding a floating upload panel with pause/resume controls and upload stats.
-   Fixed federated agent item design on home page to match local agents.
-   Fix federated agent images by correctly resolving placeholder URLs from the originating server.
-   Fixed Agents Server chat markdown rendering for sublists by normalizing unordered list indentation under ordered items.
-   Deduplicated Agents Server chat source chips so repeated document sources show only once per message.
-   Deduplicated tool call chips in Agents Server chat by stabilizing tool call identities across partial updates.
-   Fixed duplicated tool call chips (blank/filled pair) by deduplicating repeated tool call entries and rendering only the final, result-rich chip for each tool invocation.
-   Grouped identical ongoing tool call chips in Agents Server chat so concurrent tool runs collapse into a single chip with a count.
-   Fixed grouped ongoing teammate chips so tool calls from different teammates no longer collapse into one chip, while repeated calls from the same teammate still aggregate with a count.
-   Added tactile feedback for Agents Server chat tool call chips and streaming responses by routing the chat sound system into chip rendering and vibrating on every streaming chunk, so tool usage and in-progress replies feel more immersive.
-   Redesigned the Agents Server memory tool call modal so memory chips now show a friendly hero header, status badge, and scoped memory cards (query, match count, global/personal scope) instead of raw JSON blobs, making saved/loaded memories easier to understand.

        -   Shows retry button for recoverable errors (network issues, timeouts, server errors)
        -   Allows dismissing errors with cancel/close buttons
        -   Modern, polished UI with error icons and action buttons
    -   Added error handling support in `<LlmChat/>` component:
        -   Introduced optional `onError` prop to handle errors with custom logic
        -   Stores last failed message for retry functionality
        -   Provides retry callback to allow re-sending failed messages
        -   Maintains backward compatibility (errors still shown in chat if no handler provided)
    -   Integrated error handling in `AgentChatWrapper`:
        -   Uses `handleChatError` utility to categorize and format errors
        -   Displays `<ChatErrorDialog/>` with retry button for failed messages
        -   Automatically retries last failed message when user clicks retry button
    -   Improved user experience:
        -   Clear, actionable error messages instead of technical jargon
        -   Ability to retry failed operations without re-typing messages
        -   Consistent error handling across all chat interfaces
        -   Better debugging with raw errors logged to console
-   Moved the back button to the top menu bar in agent-specific pages (chat, book, etc.) using the existing hoisting mechanism for a cleaner and more consistent UI.
-   Fixed Agents Server back button menu hoisting to avoid a render loop that triggered "Maximum update depth exceeded" warnings.
-   Reduced number of capability chips in Agents Server:
    -   Grouped identical Knowledgebase chips together.
    -   Hid the `VOID` inheritance chip, showing only inheritance from other agents.
-   Limited capability chips on Agents Server cards and profiles with priority ordering and grouped knowledge/PDF sources to reduce chip overload.
-   Enhanced RAG source citation display in Agents Server chat:
    -   Replaced ugly OpenAI annotation format `【5:13†document.pdf】` with native Promptbook chips
    -   Created `<SourceChip/>` component displaying source document with file icon and citation ID
    -   Citations now appear as clickable chips below messages (similar to `USE SEARCH ENGINE` commitment)
    -   Implemented citation preview modal with:
        -   Source document name and citation ID
        -   Optional URL link to the source document
        -   Document excerpt/preview when available
        -   Clean, user-friendly UI matching existing tool call modals
    -   Added `citations` field to `ChatMessage` type for storing RAG source annotations
    -   Implemented `parseCitationsFromContent` utility to extract citations from message content
    -   Citation references in text are now rendered as numbered superscripts `[5:13]` instead of full annotations
    -   Follows DRY principle by reusing existing modal styles and chip patterns
    -   Integrated seamlessly with existing chat UI and tool call chip system
-   Enhanced document preview in Agents Server chat:
    -   Clicking on a `KNOWLEDGE` source chip now opens a document preview in an iframe (e.g. for PDFs).
    -   Added a "Download" button to the source preview modal.
    -   Automatically detects URLs in source names if explicit URL is missing.
    -   Improved fallback messaging when no preview is available.
    -   Moved close button to the top right corner with 'X' icon for better UX.
    -   Relaxed URL validation to allow previewing documents from relative paths or filenames.
    -   Ensured download button is available when source is present.
-   Added missing sound files to the Agents Server's public directory.
-   Enhanced the UI of the chips of `TEAM` commitment to show agent profile picture and name instead of ID in agent lists and profile pages.
-   Rendered chat chip emojis (tool calls and source citations) with the OpenMoji color font in Agents Server.
-   Migrate `Agent` class and all related classes from using OpenAI Assistants API to OpenAI Responses API.
    -   `KNOWLEDGE` works as before.
    -   Tool calling works as before.
    -   Caching of the agents and underlying assistants works as before.
    -   It works in the `Agents Server` application `/apps/agents-server`.
    -   All existing features work as before.
    -   Kept `OpenAiAssistantExecutionTools`, marked as deprecated and not used in `Agent`.
-   Fixed document preview and download in Agents Server chat:
    -   Resolved issue where source URLs with query parameters (e.g. from blob storage) were not matched correctly, preventing previews.
    -   Fixed download button for cross-origin files by implementing a fetch-and-download mechanism to bypass browser restrictions on `download` attribute.
-   Improve the chat UI responsiveness by allowing user interaction (sending messages) while waiting for the agent reply.
-   Fixed document preview modal for KNOWLEDGE sources in Agents Server chat:
    -   Resolved issue where document preview was showing "Agent Not Found" error due to invalid URL resolution
    -   Fixed preview to only load when a valid URL is available (checks for http:// or https://)
    -   Removed technical clutter (Citation ID, Source, URL fields) from the modal for a cleaner user experience
    -   Redesigned download button with modern styling matching the application's design system
    -   Added proper error handling when preview is unavailable, showing a user-friendly message
    -   Simplified modal header to show only document name (without file extension) for better readability
-   Fixed image generation caching to consider all generation parameters (model, size, quality, style) in the cache key, ensuring that changing these parameters generates a new image instead of returning a cached one from a previous generation with different settings.
-   Fixed image generation caching to include input images (attachments) in the cache key, ensuring that using the same prompt with different input images generates new results.
-   Improved self-learning experience in `Agent` class:
    -   The agent now returns the generated answer immediately before starting the self-learning process.
    -   Self-learning is performed asynchronously in the background.
    -   A "Self learning" chip is displayed during the learning phase, similar to tool usage chips.
    -   This enhances user experience by eliminating the wait time for self-learning completion.
-   Enhanced codebase by using explicit types instead of type inference across multiple files in `src/`, `apps/`, and `scripts/` directories to improve readability and maintainability.
-   Fix width of the message in the chat by adding a minimum width and improving layout for short messages.
-   Use model `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` for the agent of Avatar Images
-   Updated `openai` from `4.63.0` to `6.18.0` and fixed all resulting type errors.
-   Resolved `zod` peer dependency conflicts between `@ai-sdk/deepseek` and `@openai/agents` by using `overrides` in `package.json`.
-   Fixed `node-fetch` declaration issue in `LindatAutomaticTranslator.ts` by using native `URLSearchParams` and removing `node-fetch` import.
