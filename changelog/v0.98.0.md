# Version `0.98.0` _(2025-06-)_

Promptbook server has (experimental) compatibility with OpenAI API

-   You can call `book` personas as any other OpenAI model
-   Alongside `OpenAiExecutionTools` and `OpenAiAssistantExecutionTools` add `OpenAiCompatibleExecutionTools` as registration of configuration and the constructor
-   Logging all failed results not just last result
-   Do not cache failed results and bring `DEFAULT_MAX_EXECUTION_ATTEMPTS` down to 7
-   Make `gpt-4-turbo` default "vanilla" chat model of `OpenAiExecutionTools`
