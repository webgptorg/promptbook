# Version `0.27.0` _(2024-02-03)_

Moving logic from `promptbookStringToJson` to `createPtbkExecutor`

-   Allow postprocessing and expectations in all execution types
-   Postprocessing is happening before checking expectations
-   In `PromptbookJson` postprocessing is represented internally in each `PromptTemplateJson` not as separate `PromptTemplateJson`
-   Introduce `ExpectError`
-   Rename `maxNaturalExecutionAttempts` to `maxExecutionAttempts` (because now it is not just for natural execution)
-   If title in promptbook contains emojis, pass it innto report
-   Fix `description` in report
-   Asking user infinite times for input if the input not matches the expectations
