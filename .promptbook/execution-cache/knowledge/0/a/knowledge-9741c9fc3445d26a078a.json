And now, we're on the edge of the next revolution!\n\nIt's a revolution of writing software in plain human language that is understandable and executable by both humans and machines – and it's going to change everything!\n\nThe incredible growth in power of microprocessors and the Moore's Law have been the driving force behind the ever-more powerful languages, and it's been an amazing journey!
