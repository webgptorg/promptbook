The future of software is in plain English, French or Latin. During the computer revolution, we have seen multiple generations of computer languages, from the physical rewiring of the vacuum tubes through low-level machine code to the high-level languages like Python or JavaScript. And now, we're on the edge of the next revolution! It's a revolution of writing software in plain human language that is understandable and executable by both humans and machines ‚Äì and it's going to change everything! The incredible growth in power of microprocessors and the Moore's Law have been the driving force behind the ever-more powerful languages, and it's been an amazing journey! Similarly, the large language models (like GPT or Claude) are the next big thing in language technology, and they're set to transform the way we interact with computers. This shift is going to happen, whether we are ready for it or not. Our mission is to make it excellently, not just good. Join us in this journey! üöÄ Get started Take a look at the simple starter kit with books integrated into the Hello World sample applications: Hello Book Hello Book in Node.js Hello Book in Next.js üíú The Promptbook Project Promptbook project is ecosystem of multiple projects and tools, following is a list of most important pieces of the project: Project Description Link Core Promptbook Core is a description and documentation of the basic concepts, ideas and inner workings of how Promptbook should be implemented, and defines what features must be describable by book language. https://github.com/webgptorg/book Book language Book is a markdown-like language to define core entities like projects, pipelines, knowledge,.... It is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people Promptbook typescript project Promptbook implementation in TypeScript released as multiple NPM packages https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook + Multiple packages published on NPM Promptbook studio Studio to write Books and instantly publish them as miniapps https://promptbook.studio https://github.com/hejny/promptbook-studio Hello World Simple starter kit with Books integrated into the sample applications https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world-node-js https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world-next-js We also have a community of developers and users of Promptbook: Discord community Landing page ptbk.io Github discussions LinkedIn Promptbook Facebook Promptbook And Promptbook.studio branded socials: Instagram @promptbook.studio And Promptujeme sub-brand: /Subbrand for Czech clients/ Promptujeme.cz Facebook Promptujeme And Promptbook.city branded socials: /Sub-brand for images and graphics generated via Promptbook prompting/ Instagram @promptbook.city Facebook Promptbook City üíô Book language (for prompt-engineer) üíô The blueprint of book language Following is the documentation and blueprint of the Book language. Example # üåü My first Book - PERSONA Jane, marketing specialist with prior experience in writing articles about technology and artificial intelligence - KNOWLEDGE https://ptbk.io - KNOWLEDGE ./promptbook.pdf - EXPECT MIN 1 Sentence - EXPECT MAX 1 Paragraph > Write an article about the future of artificial intelligence in the next 10 years and how metalanguages will change the way AI is used in the world. > Look specifically at the impact of Promptbook on the AI industry. -> {article} Goals and principles of book language File is designed to be easy to read and write. It is strict subset of markdown. It is designed to be understandable by both humans and machines and without specific knowledge of the language. It has file with .book.md or .book extension with UTF-8 non BOM encoding. As it is source code, it can leverage all the features of version control systems like git and does not suffer from the problems of binary formats, proprietary formats, or no-code solutions. But unlike programming languages, it is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people. Structure Book is divided into sections. Each section starts with heading. The language itself is not sensitive to the type of heading (h1, h2, h3, ...) but it is recommended to use h1 for header section and h2 for other sections. Header Header is the first section of the book. It contains metadata about the pipeline. It is recommended to use h1 heading for header section but it is not required.

This can happen due to the model's training data, the prompt's wording, or the model's architecture. Pipeline, workflow or chain is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order. In the context of AI, a pipeline can refer to a sequence of AI models that are used to process data. Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained AI model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task. Zero-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task without any labeled examples. Instead, the model is provided with a description of the task and is expected to generate the correct output. Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task with only a few labeled examples. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where models are trained on large datasets. Meta-learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a variety of tasks and is able to learn new tasks with minimal additional training. This is achieved by learning a set of meta-parameters that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation is a machine learning paradigm where a model generates text by retrieving relevant information from a large database of text. This approach combines the benefits of generative models and retrieval models. Longtail refers to non-common or rare events, items, or entities that are not well-represented in the training data of machine learning models. Longtail items are often challenging for models to predict accurately.

The future of software is in plain English, French or Latin. During the computer revolution, we have seen multiple generations of computer languages, from the physical rewiring of the vacuum tubes through low-level machine code to the high-level languages like Python or JavaScript. And now, we're on the edge of the next revolution! It's a revolution of writing software in plain human language that is understandable and executable by both humans and machines ‚Äì and it's going to change everything! The incredible growth in power of microprocessors and the Moore's Law have been the driving force behind the ever-more powerful languages, and it's been an amazing journey! Similarly, the large language models (like GPT or Claude) are the next big thing in language technology, and they're set to transform the way we interact with computers. This shift is going to happen, whether we are ready for it or not. Our mission is to make it excellently, not just good. Join us in this journey! üöÄ Get started Take a look at the simple starter kit with books integrated into the Hello World sample applications: Hello Book Hello Book in Node.js Hello Book in Next.js üíú The Promptbook Project Promptbook project is ecosystem of multiple projects and tools, following is a list of most important pieces of the project: Project Description Link Core Promptbook Core is a description and documentation of the basic concepts, ideas and inner workings of how Promptbook should be implemented, and defines what features must be describable by book language. https://github.com/webgptorg/book Book language Book is a markdown-like language to define core entities like projects, pipelines, knowledge,.... It is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people Promptbook typescript project Promptbook implementation in TypeScript released as multiple NPM packages https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook + Multiple packages published on NPM Promptbook studio Studio to write Books and instantly publish them as miniapps https://promptbook.studio https://github.com/hejny/promptbook-studio Hello World Simple starter kit with Books integrated into the sample applications https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world-node-js https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world-next-js We also have a community of developers and users of Promptbook: Discord community Landing page ptbk.io Github discussions LinkedIn Promptbook Facebook Promptbook And Promptbook.studio branded socials: Instagram @promptbook.studio And Promptujeme sub-brand: /Subbrand for Czech clients/ Promptujeme.cz Facebook Promptujeme And Promptbook.city branded socials: /Sub-brand for images and graphics generated via Promptbook prompting/ Instagram @promptbook.city Facebook Promptbook City üíô Book language (for prompt-engineer) üíô The blueprint of book language Following is the documentation and blueprint of the Book language. Example # üåü My first Book - PERSONA Jane, marketing specialist with prior experience in writing articles about technology and artificial intelligence - KNOWLEDGE https://ptbk.io - KNOWLEDGE ./promptbook.pdf - EXPECT MIN 1 Sentence - EXPECT MAX 1 Paragraph > Write an article about the future of artificial intelligence in the next 10 years and how metalanguages will change the way AI is used in the world. > Look specifically at the impact of Promptbook on the AI industry. -> \\{article\\} Goals and principles of book language File is designed to be easy to read and write. It is strict subset of markdown. It is designed to be understandable by both humans and machines and without specific knowledge of the language. It has file with .book.md or .book extension with UTF-8 non BOM encoding. As it is source code, it can leverage all the features of version control systems like git and does not suffer from the problems of binary formats, proprietary formats, or no-code solutions. But unlike programming languages, it is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people. Structure Book is divided into sections. Each section starts with heading. The language itself is not sensitive to the type of heading (h1, h2, h3, ...) but it is recommended to use h1 for header section and h2 for other sections. Header Header is the first section of the book. It contains metadata about the pipeline. It is recommended to use h1 heading for header section but it is not required.

This can happen due to the model's training data, the prompt's wording, or the model's architecture. Pipeline, workflow or chain is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order. In the context of AI, a pipeline can refer to a sequence of AI models that are used to process data. Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained AI model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task. Zero-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task without any labeled examples. Instead, the model is provided with a description of the task and is expected to generate the correct output. Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task with only a few labeled examples. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where models are trained on large datasets. Meta-learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a variety of tasks and is able to learn new tasks with minimal additional training. This is achieved by learning a set of meta-parameters that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation is a machine learning paradigm where a model generates text by retrieving relevant information from a large database of text. This approach combines the benefits of generative models and retrieval models. Longtail refers to non-common or rare events, items, or entities that are not well-represented in the training data of machine learning models. Longtail items are often challenging for models to predict accurately.
