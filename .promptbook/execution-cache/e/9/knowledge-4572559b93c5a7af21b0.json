This can happen due to the model's training data, the prompt's wording, or the model's architecture. Pipeline, workflow or chain is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order. In the context of AI, a pipeline can refer to a sequence of AI models that are used to process data. Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained AI model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task. Zero-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task without any labeled examples. Instead, the model is provided with a description of the task and is expected to generate the correct output. Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task with only a few labeled examples. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where models are trained on large datasets. Meta-learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a variety of tasks and is able to learn new tasks with minimal additional training. This is achieved by learning a set of meta-parameters that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation is a machine learning paradigm where a model generates text by retrieving relevant information from a large database of text. This approach combines the benefits of generative models and retrieval models. Longtail refers to non-common or rare events, items, or entities that are not well-represented in the training data of machine learning models. Longtail items are often challenging for models to predict accurately.

Join us in this journey! 🚀 Get started Take a look at the simple starter kit with books integrated into the Hello World sample applications: Hello Book Hello Book in Node.js Hello Book in Next.js 💜 The Promptbook Project Promptbook project is ecosystem of multiple projects and tools, following is a list of most important pieces of the project: Project Description Link Core Promptbook Core is a description and documentation of the basic concepts, ideas and inner workings of how Promptbook should be implemented, and defines what features must be describable by book language. https://github.com/webgptorg/book Book language Book is a markdown-like language to define core entities like projects, pipelines, knowledge,.... It is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people Promptbook typescript project Promptbook implementation in TypeScript released as multiple NPM packages https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook + Multiple packages published on NPM Promptbook studio Studio to write Books and instantly publish them as miniapps https://promptbook.studio https://github.com/hejny/promptbook-studio Hello World Simple starter kit with Books integrated into the sample applications https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world-node-js https://github.com/webgptorg/hello-world-next-js We also have a community of developers and users of Promptbook: Discord community Landing page ptbk.io Github discussions LinkedIn Promptbook Facebook Promptbook And Promptbook.studio branded socials: Instagram @promptbook.studio And Promptujeme sub-brand: /Subbrand for Czech clients/ Promptujeme.cz Facebook Promptujeme And Promptbook.city branded socials: /Sub-brand for images and graphics generated via Promptbook prompting/ Instagram @promptbook.city Facebook Promptbook City 💙 Book language (for prompt-engineer) 💙 The blueprint of book language Following is the documentation and blueprint of the Book language. Example # 🌟 My first Book - PERSONA Jane, marketing specialist with prior experience in writing articles about technology and artificial intelligence - KNOWLEDGE https://ptbk.io - KNOWLEDGE ./promptbook.pdf - EXPECT MIN 1 Sentence - EXPECT MAX 1 Paragraph > Write an article about the future of artificial intelligence in the next 10 years and how metalanguages will change the way AI is used in the world. > Look specifically at the impact of Promptbook on the AI industry. -> \\{article\\} Goals and principles of book language File is designed to be easy to read and write. It is strict subset of markdown. It is designed to be understandable by both humans and machines and without specific knowledge of the language. It has file with .book.md or .book extension with UTF-8 non BOM encoding. As it is source code, it can leverage all the features of version control systems like git and does not suffer from the problems of binary formats, proprietary formats, or no-code solutions. But unlike programming languages, it is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people. Structure Book is divided into sections. Each section starts with heading. The language itself is not sensitive to the type of heading (h1, h2, h3, ...) but it is recommended to use h1 for header section and h2 for other sections. Header Header is the first section of the book. It contains metadata about the pipeline. It is recommended to use h1 heading for header section but it is not required.

This can happen due to the model's training data, the prompt's wording, or the model's architecture. Pipeline, workflow or chain is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order. In the context of AI, a pipeline can refer to a sequence of AI models that are used to process data. Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained AI model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task. Zero-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task without any labeled examples. Instead, the model is provided with a description of the task and is expected to generate the correct output. Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task with only a few labeled examples. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where models are trained on large datasets. Meta-learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a variety of tasks and is able to learn new tasks with minimal additional training. This is achieved by learning a set of meta-parameters that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation is a machine learning paradigm where a model generates text by retrieving relevant information from a large database of text. This approach combines the benefits of generative models and retrieval models. Longtail refers to non-common or rare events, items, or entities that are not well-represented in the training data of machine learning models. Longtail items are often challenging for models to predict accurately.

When you want to separate code from text prompts When you want to describe complex prompt pipelines and don't want to do it in the code When you want to orchestrate multiple prompts together When you want to reuse parts of prompts in multiple places When you want to version your prompts and test multiple versions When you want to log the execution of prompts and backtrace the issues See more ➖ When not to use When you have already implemented single simple prompt and it works fine for your job When OpenAI Assistant (GPTs) is enough for you When you need streaming (this may be implemented in the future, see discussion). When you need to use something other than JavaScript or TypeScript (other languages are on the way, see the discussion) When your main focus is on something other than text - like images, audio, video, spreadsheets (other media types may be added in the future, see discussion) When you need to use recursion (see the discussion) See more 🐜 Known issues 🤸‍♂️ Iterations not working yet ⤵️ Imports not working yet 🧼 Intentionally not implemented features ➿ No recursion 🏳 There are no types, just strings ❔ FAQ If you have a question start a discussion, open an issue or write me an email. ❔ Why not just use the OpenAI SDK / Anthropic Claude SDK / ...? ❔ How is it different from the OpenAI\\`s GPTs? ❔ How is it different from the Langchain? ❔ How is it different from the DSPy? ❔ How is it different from anything? ❔ Is Promptbook using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)? ❔ Is Promptbook using function calling? ⌚ Changelog See CHANGELOG.md 📜 License Promptbook by Pavol Hejný is licensed under CC BY 4.0 🎯 Todos See TODO.md 🤝 Partners 🖋️ Contributing I am open to pull requests, feedback, and suggestions.
