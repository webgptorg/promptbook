🤍 The Book Abstract
It's time for a paradigm shift! The future of software is in plain English, French or Latin.
During the computer revolution, we have seen multiple generations of computer languages, from the physical rewiring of the vacuum tubes through low-level machine code to the high-level languages like Python or JavaScript. And now, we're on the edge of the next revolution!
It's a revolution of writing software in plain human language that is understandable and executable by both humans and machines – and it's going to change everything!
The incredible growth in power of microprocessors and the Moore's Law have been the driving force behind the ever-more powerful languages, and it's been an amazing journey! Similarly, the large language models (like GPT or Claude) are the next big thing in language technology, and they're set to transform the way we interact with computers.
This shift is going to happen, whether we are ready for it or not. Our mission is to make it excellently, not just good.
Join us in this journey!

General principles of book language
Book language is based on markdown. It is subset of markdown. It is designed to be easy to read and write. It is designed to be understandable by both humans and machines and without specific knowledge of the language.
The file has .book extension. It uses UTF-8 non BOM encoding.
Book has two variants: flat - which is just a prompt with no structure, and full - which has a structure with tasks, commands and prompts.
As it is source code, it can leverage all the features of version control systems like git and does not suffer from the problems of binary formats, proprietary formats, or no-code solutions.
But unlike programming languages, it is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people.

📦 Packages (for developers)
This library is divided into several packages, all are published from single monorepo.
You can install all of them at once:

Or you can install them separately:

⭐ Marked packages are worth to try first

📚 Dictionary
📚 Dictionary
The following glossary is used to clarify certain concepts:
General LLM / AI terms

Prompt drift is a phenomenon where the AI model starts to generate outputs that are not aligned with the original prompt. This can happen due to the model's training data, the prompt's wording, or the model's architecture.
Pipeline, workflow or chain is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order. In the context of AI, a pipeline can refer to a sequence of AI models that are used to process data.
Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained AI model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task.
Zero-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task without any labeled examples. Instead, the model is provided with a description of the task and is expected to generate the correct output.
Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task with only a few labeled examples. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where models are trained on large datasets.
Meta-learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a variety of tasks and is able to learn new tasks with minimal additional training. This is achieved by learning a set of meta-parameters that can be quickly adapted to new tasks.
Retrieval-augmented generation is a machine learning paradigm where a model generates text by retrieving relevant information from a large database of text. This approach combines the benefits of generative models and retrieval models.
Longtail refers to non-common or rare events, items, or entities that are not well-represented in the training data of machine learning models. Longtail items are often challenging for models to predict accurately.
