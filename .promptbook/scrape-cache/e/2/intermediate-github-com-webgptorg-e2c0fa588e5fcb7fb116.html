✨ Promptbook: AI apps in plain Language
Write AI applications using plain human language across multiple models and platforms.









🌟 New Features





🤍 The Book Abstract
It's time for a paradigm shift! The future of software is in plain English, French or Latin.
During the computer revolution, we have seen multiple generations of computer languages, from the physical rewiring of the vacuum tubes through low-level machine code to the high-level languages like Python or JavaScript. And now, we're on the edge of the next revolution!
It's a revolution of writing software in plain human language that is understandable and executable by both humans and machines – and it's going to change everything!
The incredible growth in power of microprocessors and the Moore's Law have been the driving force behind the ever-more powerful languages, and it's been an amazing journey! Similarly, the large language models (like GPT or Claude) are the next big thing in language technology, and they're set to transform the way we interact with computers.
This shift is going to happen, whether we are ready for it or not. Our mission is to make it excellently, not just good.
Join us in this journey!

      Book language
      
          Book is a human-understandable markup language for writing AI applications such as chatbots, knowledge bases, agents, avarars, translators, automations and more.
          
          There is also a plugin for VSCode to support .book file extension
      
    
    
      Promptbook Engine
      
          Promptbook engine can run applications written in Book language. It is released as multiple NPM packages and Docker HUB
      
    
    
      Promptbook Studio
      
          Promptbook.studio is a web-based editor and runner for book applications. It is still in the experimental MVP stage.

📘 Book Language Blueprint
A concise, Markdown-based DSL for crafting AI workflows and automations.
Introduction
Book is a Markdown-based language that simplifies the creation of AI applications, workflows, and automations. With human-readable commands, you can define inputs, outputs, personas, knowledge sources, and actions—without needing model-specific details.
Example

Each part of the book defines one of 3 circles:
1. What: Workflows, Tasks and Parameters
What work needs to be done. Each book defines a workflow (scenario or pipeline), which is one or more tasks. Each workflow has a fixed input and output. For example, you have a book that generates an article from a topic. Once it generates an article about AI, once about marketing, once about cooking. The workflow (= your AI program) is the same, only the input and output change.
Related commands:

2. Who: Personas
Who does the work. Each task is performed by a persona. A persona is a description of your virtual employee. It is a higher abstraction than the model, tokens, temperature, top-k, top-p and other model parameters.
You can describe what you want in human language like Jane, creative writer with a sense of sharp humour instead of gpt-4-2024-13-31, temperature 1.2, top-k 40, STOP token ".\n",....
Personas can have access to different knowledge, tools and actions. They can also consult their work with other personas or user, if allowed.
Related commands:

3. How: Knowledge, Instruments and Actions
The resources used by the personas are used to do the work.
Related commands:

KNOWLEDGE of documents, websites, and other resources
INSTRUMENT for real-time data like time, location, weather, stock prices, searching the internet, calculations, etc.
ACTION for actions like sending emails, creating files, ending a workflow, etc.

General Principles
Book language is based on markdown. It is subset of markdown. It is designed to be easy to read and write. It is designed to be understandable by both humans and machines and without specific knowledge of the language.
The file has .book extension. It uses UTF-8 non BOM encoding.
Book has two variants: flat - which is just a prompt with no structure, and full - which has a structure with tasks, commands and prompts.
As it is source code, it can leverage all the features of version control systems like git and does not suffer from the problems of binary formats, proprietary formats, or no-code solutions.
But unlike programming languages, it is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people.
