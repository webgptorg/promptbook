            Defines a specific situation or context in which the AI assistant should operate. It helps to set the scene for the AI's responses. Later scenarios are more important than earlier scenarios.

            ## Key behaviors

            - Multiple \`SCENARIO\` and \`SCENARIOS\` commitments build upon each other.
            - Both terms work identically and can be used interchangeably.
            - Later scenarios have higher priority and can override earlier scenarios.
            - Provides situational context that influences response tone and content.
            - Helps establish the environment and circumstances for interactions.

            ## Priority system

            When multiple scenarios are defined, they are processed in order, with later scenarios taking precedence over earlier ones when there are conflicts.

            ## Use cases

            - Setting the physical or virtual environment
            - Establishing time constraints or urgency
            - Defining relationship dynamics or power structures
            - Creating emotional or situational context
