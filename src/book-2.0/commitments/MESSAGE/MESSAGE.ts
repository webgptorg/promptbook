            ## Key aspects

            - Multiple \`MESSAGE\` and \`MESSAGES\` commitments represent the conversation timeline.
            - Both terms work identically and can be used interchangeably.
            - Later messages are later in the conversation chronologically.
            - Contains actual historical messages, not examples or templates.
            - Helps maintain conversation continuity and context.

            ## Differences from EXAMPLE

            - \`EXAMPLE\` shows hypothetical or template responses
            - \`MESSAGE\`/\`MESSAGES\` contains actual historical conversation content
            - \`MESSAGE\`/\`MESSAGES\` preserves the exact conversation flow
            - \`MESSAGE\`/\`MESSAGES\` helps with context awareness and consistency

            ## Use cases

            - Maintaining conversation history context
            - Ensuring consistent tone and style across messages
            - Referencing previous responses in ongoing conversations
            - Building upon previously established context
