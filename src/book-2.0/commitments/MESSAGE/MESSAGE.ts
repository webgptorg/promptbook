 * Example usage in agent source:

 * MESSAGES I understand you're looking for information about our services.
 * MESSAGE Based on your requirements, I'd recommend our premium package.

            ## Key behaviors

            - Multiple \`${this.canonicalType}\`/\`${this.pluralType}\` commitments represent the conversation timeline.
            - Later messages are later in the conversation chronologically.
            - Contains actual historical messages, not examples or templates.
            - Helps maintain conversation continuity and context.

            ## Differences from EXAMPLE

            - \`EXAMPLE\` shows hypothetical or template responses
            - \`${this.canonicalType}\`/\`${this.pluralType}\` contains actual historical conversation content
            - \`${this.canonicalType}\`/\`${this.pluralType}\` preserves the exact conversation flow
            - \`${this.canonicalType}\`/\`${this.pluralType}\` helps with context awareness and consistency

            ## Use cases

            - Maintaining conversation history context
            - Ensuring consistent tone and style across messages
            - Referencing previous responses in ongoing conversations
            - Building upon previously established context
