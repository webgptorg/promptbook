/**
 * NOTE commitment definition
 *
 * The NOTE commitment is used to add comments to the agent source without making any changes
 * to the system message or agent model requirements. It serves as a documentation mechanism
 * for developers to add explanatory comments, reminders, or annotations directly in the agent source.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Makes no changes to the system message
 * - Makes no changes to agent model requirements
 * - Content is preserved in metadata.NOTE for debugging and inspection
 * - Multiple NOTE commitments are aggregated together
 * - Comments (# NOTE) are removed from the final system message
 *
 * Example usage in agent source:
 *
 * ```book
 * NOTE This agent was designed for customer support scenarios
 * NOTE Remember to update the knowledge base monthly
 * NOTE Performance optimized for quick response times
 * ```
 *
 * The above notes will be stored in metadata but won't affect the agent's behavior.
 *
 * @private [ðŸª”] Maybe export the commitments through some package

            Adds comments for documentation without changing system message or model requirements.

            Key behaviors:

            - Aggregates multiple NOTE lines into metadata.NOTE.

            \`\`\`book
            NOTE This agent was designed for customer support scenarios
            NOTE Remember to update the knowledge base monthly
            NOTE Performance optimized for quick response times
