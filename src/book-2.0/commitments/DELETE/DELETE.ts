            A commitment to remove or disregard certain information or context. This can be useful for overriding previous commitments or removing unwanted behaviors.

            ## Aliases

            - Can be used to remove inherited behaviors from base personas.
            - Helps fine-tune agent behavior by explicitly removing unwanted elements.

            ## Use cases

            - Overriding inherited persona characteristics
