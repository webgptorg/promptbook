/**
 * STYLE commitment definition
 *
 * The STYLE commitment defines how the agent should format and present its responses.
 * This includes tone, writing style, formatting preferences, and communication patterns.
 *
 * Example usage in agent source:
 *
 * ```book
 * STYLE Write in a professional but friendly tone, use bullet points for lists
 * STYLE Always provide code examples when explaining programming concepts
 * ```
 *
 * @private [ðŸª”] Maybe export the commitments through some package

            Defines how the agent should format and present its responses (tone, writing style, formatting).

            ## Key behaviors

            - Multiple \`STYLE\` and \`STYLES\` commitments are applied sequentially.
            - Both terms work identically and can be used interchangeably.
            - Later style instructions can override earlier ones.
            - Style affects both tone and presentation format.
