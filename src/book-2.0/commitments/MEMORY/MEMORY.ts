            Similar to KNOWLEDGE but focuses on remembering past interactions and user preferences. This commitment helps the agent maintain context about the user's history, preferences, and previous conversations.

            ## Key behaviors

            - Multiple \`MEMORY\` commitments are applied sequentially.
            - Focuses on user-specific information and interaction history.
            - Helps personalize responses based on past interactions.
            - Maintains continuity across conversations.

            ## Differences from KNOWLEDGE

            - \`KNOWLEDGE\` is for domain expertise and factual information
            - \`MEMORY\` is for user-specific context and preferences
            - \`MEMORY\` creates more personalized interactions
            - \`MEMORY\` often includes temporal or preference-based information
