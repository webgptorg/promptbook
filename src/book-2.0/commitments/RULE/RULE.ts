 * RULES Never provide medical advice, always refer to healthcare professionals
 * ```

            Adds behavioral constraints and guidelines that the agent must follow.

            ## Key behaviors

            - Multiple \`RULE\` and \`RULES\` commitments are applied sequentially.
            - All rules are treated equally regardless of singular/plural form.
            - Rules define what the agent must or must not do.
