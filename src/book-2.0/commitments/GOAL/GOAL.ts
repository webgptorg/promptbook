 * ```book
 * GOAL Help users understand complex technical concepts
 * GOAL Provide accurate and up-to-date information
 * GOAL Always prioritize user safety and ethical guidelines
 * ```

 * @private [ðŸª”] Maybe export the commitments through some package

            Defines the main goal which should be achieved by the AI assistant. There can be multiple goals, and later goals are more important than earlier goals.

            ## Key behaviors

            - Multiple \`GOAL\` and \`GOALS\` commitments are applied sequentially.
            - Both terms work identically and can be used interchangeably.
            - Later goals have higher priority and can override earlier goals.
            - Goals provide clear direction and purpose for the agent's responses.
            - Goals influence decision-making and response prioritization.

            ## Priority system

            When multiple goals are defined, they are processed in order, with later goals taking precedence over earlier ones when there are conflicts.
