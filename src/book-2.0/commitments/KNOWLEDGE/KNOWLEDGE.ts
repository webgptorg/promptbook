/**
 * KNOWLEDGE commitment definition
 *
 * The KNOWLEDGE commitment adds specific knowledge, facts, or context to the agent
 * using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach for external sources.
 *
 * Supports both direct text knowledge and external sources like PDFs.
 *
 * Example usage in agent source:
 *
 * ```book
 * KNOWLEDGE The company was founded in 2020 and specializes in AI-powered solutions
 * KNOWLEDGE https://example.com/company-handbook.pdf
 * KNOWLEDGE https://example.com/product-documentation.pdf
 * ```

 * @private [ðŸª”] Maybe export the commitments through some package

            Adds specific knowledge, facts, or context to the agent using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach for external sources.

            ## Key behaviors

            - Both terms work identically and can be used interchangeably.
            - Supports both direct text knowledge and external URLs.
            - External sources (PDFs, websites) are processed via RAG for context retrieval.

            ## Supported formats

            - Direct text: Immediate knowledge incorporated into agent
            - URLs: External documents processed for contextual retrieval
            - Supported file types: PDF, text, markdown, HTML
