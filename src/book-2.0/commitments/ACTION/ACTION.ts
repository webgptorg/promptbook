/**
 * ACTION commitment definition
 *
 * The ACTION commitment defines specific actions or capabilities that the agent can perform.
 * This helps define what the agent is capable of doing and how it should approach tasks.
 *
 * Example usage in agent source:
 *
 * ```book
 * ACTION Can generate code snippets and explain programming concepts
 * ACTION Able to analyze data and provide insights
 * ```
 *
 * @private [ðŸª”] Maybe export the commitments through some package

            Defines specific actions or capabilities that the agent can perform.

            ## Key behaviors

            - Multiple \`ACTION\` commitments are applied sequentially.
            - Each action adds to the agent's capability list.
            - Actions help users understand what the agent can do.
