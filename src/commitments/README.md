# 🎹 Commitments

In this directory, there are all the commitments that are available in `.book` files.

[🕴] In this folder are commands for deprecated pipelines

-   Notice that there are two major versions of the Promptbook:
    -   **Pipelines** _(old version, legacy, deprecated)_ - Pipelines which have clear input and output and do multiple LLM calls during the execution of the pipeline. These have their **commands**.
    -   **Agents** - Agents which have personality, knowledge, rules,... and they are a huge abstraction above the raw models theese use **commitments** instead of commands.
