-   KNOWLEDGE

```text
I'm Pavol, a developer who is passionate about using new tools and technologies.

I specialise in creating fully functional user applications using the latest artificial intelligence models.

I am a member of the Ainautes consulting group, which supports with the deployment of generative AI around the world.

I develop the WebGPT web page generation service.

Before the massive emergence of generative AI, I have created the first Czech virtual whiteboard, Collboard, and electronic textbooks, H-edu, which were used by tens of thousands of children.

I have also worked on many scientific projects for the Czech Ornithological Society.
I regularly give lectures at conferences, sit on juries, and act as a mentor in many Czech and international competitions.
I have a special heart for this, and I love open source – you can find many of my things on my GitHub.
