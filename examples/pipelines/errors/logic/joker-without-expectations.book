# ðŸŸ¡ Example: Joker without expectations

This example is a joker that does not have any expectations

-   INPUTâ€¯â€¯PARAMETER {yourName} Name of the hero or nothing
-   OUTPUT PARAMETER `{name}`

## ðŸ’¬ Question

This joker will always meet the expectations, because it does not have any
So it triggers logic error.

-   JOKER {yourName}

```markdown
Write some name for hero
```

`-> {name}`
