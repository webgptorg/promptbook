# 🔴 Example of parsing error

Example of wrong pipeline that has a non-prompt template with a model command + reverse order of commands

## 💬 Prompt

This prompt is invalid because it is declared in a language that is not supported by the model.

-   MODEL NAME `gpt-3.5-turbo`
-   SIMPLE TEMPLATE

```
Hello;
```

`-> {greeting}`
