[🕴] In this folder are deprecated pipelines
-   Notice that there are two major versions of the Promptbook:
    -   **Pipelines** _(old version, legacy, deprecated)_ - Pipelines which have clear input and output and do multiple LLM calls during the execution of the pipeline.
    -   **Agents** - Agents which have personality, knowledge, rules,... and they are a huge abstraction above the raw models.
