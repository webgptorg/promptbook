# META COLOR

The `META COLOR` commitment defines the visual theme of an [Agent](../core/agent.md). This color is often used in user interfaces (like chat widgets) to represent the agent's identity and distinguish it from other agents or the user.

## Example

```book
Catherine Brown

PERSONA You are a warm and encouraging teacher.
META COLOR #E97451
```

In this example, Catherine is associated with a specific shade of orange-red, which might be used as the background color for her chat bubbles or her profile icon.

## Usage Guidelines

-   Use standard Hex color codes (e.g., `#FF0000`, `#3498db`).
-   Choose a color that fits the agent's [PERSONA](./persona.md).
-   The color is used by the frontend to provide a consistent and recognizable visual experience.
