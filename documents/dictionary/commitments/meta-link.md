# META LINK

The `META LINK` commitment provides relevant external links that are associated with an [Agent](../core/agent.md). These links can point to the agent's source code, documentation, the author's website, or any other useful resource.

## Example

```book
Catherine Brown

PERSONA You are a professional architect.
META LINK https://github.com/webgptorg/book/blob/main/books/architect.book.md
META LINK https://catherine-brown-portfolio.com
```

In this example, Catherine's profile will include links to her source [Book File](../core/book-file.md) and her personal portfolio.

## Usage Guidelines

-   Provide a valid URL.
-   Multiple `META LINK` commitments can be used to provide several links.
-   These links are typically displayed on the agent's profile page or in the "About" section of a chat interface.
