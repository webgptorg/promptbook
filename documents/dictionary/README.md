## 💡 About Versions

The Promptbook has evolved through two major paradigms:

1.  **Pipelines** _(Legacy)_: Focuses on structured input/output flows and chaining multiple LLM calls.
2.  **Agents** _(Modern)_: Focuses on creating autonomous entities with persona, knowledge, and capabilities.

Most concepts in this dictionary apply to both, but specific differences are noted where applicable.
