# Promptbook Dictionary

Welcome to the Promptbook Dictionary. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the terms, concepts, and definitions used within the Promptbook ecosystem.

## Structure

The dictionary is organized into several categories:

-   [**Core Concepts**](./core/README.md) - Fundamental ideas like Agents, Pipelines, and the Promptbook itself.
-   [**Commitments**](./commitments/README.md) - Modern syntax elements used to define Agent behavior.
-   [**Pipelines (Legacy)**](./pipelines/README.md) - Concepts specific to the older, deprecated Pipeline version of Promptbook.
-   [**Technical Terms**](./technical/README.md) - Underlying technologies and technical implementations.

## Major Versions

It is important to distinguish between the two major versions of Promptbook:

1.  **Agents** (Modern): Highly abstracted AI entities with personality, knowledge, and rules. This is the current and recommended way to use Promptbook.
2.  **Pipelines** (Legacy): Structured sequences of LLM calls with clear inputs and outputs. While deprecated, many concepts are shared with the modern Agent version.
