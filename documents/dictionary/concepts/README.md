# 🧠 Concepts

**Concepts** are the underlying principles, ideas, and abstract patterns that power the Promptbook ecosystem. They provide the "why" behind the technical implementation and help developers think about AI in a more structured way.

💡 Understanding these concepts is key to mastering Promptbook and creating effective AI workflows.

## 📂 Fundamental Concepts

-   [**Expectations**](./expectations.md) - Defining and validating what an AI output should look like.
-   [**Separation of Concerns**](./separation-of-concerns.md) - Decoupling prompt logic from application code.
-   [**Words not Tokens**](./words-not-tokens.md) - A human-centric approach to measuring and controlling text generation.
-   [**Postprocessing**](./postprocessing.md) - Refining and transforming AI outputs after they are generated.
-   [**Knowledge (RAG)**](./knowledge-rag.md) - How agents retrieve and use external information.
-   [**Metaprompting**](./metaprompting.md) - Creating prompts that generate or improve other prompts.
-   [**Anomaly Detection**](./anomaly-detection.md) - Identifying when an AI has "hallucinated" or produced an invalid response.
-   [**Formfactors**](./formfactors.md) - Different ways an AI can be presented to the user (Chatbot, Sheet, Generator, etc.).

## 💡 Philosophy

Promptbook is built on the belief that AI logic should be treated as **source code**. It should be versioned, tested, compiled, and maintained with the same rigor as traditional software, while remaining accessible to non-programmers through its natural-language-like syntax.
