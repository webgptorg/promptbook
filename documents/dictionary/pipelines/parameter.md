# 📋 `PARAMETER`

A **Parameter** (also known as a Variable) is a core structural element in [Pipelines](../pipelines/README.md) that allows for dynamic data to be passed into and between prompt templates. Parameters are denoted by curly braces, e.g., `{parameterName}`.

💡 Parameters are the "glue" that connects different steps of a pipeline together.

## Usage in Templates

In a [Pipeline](../pipelines/README.md), you define parameters in the [Book file](../structure/book-file.md) and then use them within your prompt text.

```book
## Write a Greeting

Write a friendly greeting for {userName}.

➔ `greeting`
```

## Types of Parameters

1.  **Input Parameters**: Provided by the user or application at the start of execution.
2.  **Intermediate Parameters**: Generated by one template and used as input for a subsequent template (e.g., `greeting` in the example above).
3.  **Output Parameters**: The final results of the pipeline execution that are returned to the user or application.

## Example

```book
# 📝 Personalized Story Generator

## 📥 Inputs
- `childName`
- `favoriteAnimal`

## 📖 Step 1: Character Description
Write a description of a brave {favoriteAnimal} named {childName}.
➔ `character`

## 📖 Step 2: Story Opening
Start a story about {character} going on an adventure.
➔ `storyOpening`
```

In this example, `childName` and `favoriteAnimal` are **Input Parameters**, `character` is an **Intermediate Parameter**, and `storyOpening` is the final **Output Parameter**.

## Context in Agents

In the [Agent](../agents/README.md) paradigm, parameters are less central because the interaction is typically a direct conversation between the user and the agent. However, parameters can still be used to inject context or user data into the agent's initial system prompt or to handle specific structured data tasks.
