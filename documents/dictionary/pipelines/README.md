# Pipelines (Legacy)

Concepts and terms specifically related to the older, deprecated version of Promptbook. While these are mostly legacy, many are still used in the background or for highly structured deterministic workflows.

-   [**Task**](./task.md) - A single step within a pipeline.
-   [**Parameter**](./parameter.md) - A variable used to pass data between tasks.
-   [**Expectations**](./expect.md) - Validation rules for the output of a task.
-   [**Joker**](./joker.md) - A special syntax for handling unexpected or fallback scenarios.
-   [**Foreach**](./foreach.md) - Iterating over a collection of data (e.g., CSV rows).
