# Why We Should Opt for BUSL-1.1

Our key requirements for the license are to:

-   **Protect Intellectual Property:** Prevent competitors from freely using our code during the early stages.
-   **Control Commercial Use:** Restrict production use (e.g., large-scale deployments or competitive services) to safeguard our business model.
-   **Enable Future Monetization:** Provide a pathway to monetize intense or commercial usage while eventually transitioning to an open model.
-   **Ensure Compatibility:** Be included in the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) for broad industry acceptance and tooling support.

## Why BUSL-1.1 Meets Our Needs

-   **Time-Based Restriction:**  
    BUSL-1.1 restricts production use for a defined period (typically 2–3 years), after which it automatically converts to a permissive license (such as Apache 2.0 or MIT). This allows us to build and monetize our ecosystem initially and open the code later.

-   **Competitive Safeguards:**  
    Its initial restrictions prevent competitors from exploiting our code to create similar products or services during our early business stages.

-   **SPDX Inclusion:**  
    BUSL-1.1 is listed in the SPDX License List, ensuring that our licensing choice is compatible with industry standards and recognized by a wide range of development and compliance tools.

-   **Proven Adoption:**  
    This license model has been successfully used by companies to balance commercial control with eventual open access, aligning well with our strategic goals.

## Conclusion

BUSL-1.1 aligns with our strategic objectives by protecting our intellectual property, controlling early commercial use, and providing a clear path to future monetization—all while being an SPDX-listed license.
