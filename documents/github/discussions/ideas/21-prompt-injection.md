Another interesting thing is the theme of false (self-)validation and self-regulation: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mrdavediamond_chatgpt-told-me-i-was-brilliant-and-i-activity-7318390230959407105-CwQ8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB3d6hwBNk9xwhaSn5hoWTatZ-YB2zeYIQk

Another, loosely connected theme is that of human well-being in the AI era: https://medium.com/aimonks/the-dark-side-of-ai-companionship-lessons-from-sewell-setzers-tragic-story-34e4505d9da2

Where do these themes fit in and how does Promptbook mitigate the risks?

@hejny By the way, the domain that could be connected with the "safe-worlds" webpage above could read `eldamar.io`, `eldamar.ai` or `eldamar.ptbk.io`.

Explanation: In Tolkien’s lore, Eldamar is the blessed region on the shores of Valinor where the Valar first set foot in Middle‑earth’s “Undying Lands.” It conveys the same sense of inviolate safety and purity as Valinor, but with its own distinct ring. ;-)
