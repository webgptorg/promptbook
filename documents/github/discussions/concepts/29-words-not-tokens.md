            |Language| models| generate| one| [token](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)| at| a| time|.| But tokens are such a low-level concept. Each model has its own tokenization and they are not humanly comprehensible.


            > You don't need to know x86 instructions to build a great web page, and with Promptbook you don't need to struggle with tokens to write a great LM application.

            Promptbook abstracts from tokens and uses human-understandable units like `characters`, `words`, `sentences`, `paragraphs` and `pages`. `max-tokens` and other technical stuff is done automatically on the background.
