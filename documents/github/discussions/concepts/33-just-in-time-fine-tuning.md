            When you use language models, you have a choice:

            1) use a strong model (such as gpt-4) and pay nothing up front, but more as you go.
            2) You can fine tune the model, which requires a lot of data and you also have to pay for training, but then you can get better results and pay less.

            > 💡 But there is a third option, just-in-time compilation.


            We can do something similar with model training and fine tuning:


            3) Just use the strong model for the first x runs and then start fine tuning with the data from those x runs.

## 🔎 Existing solutions

_(Do some research / discussion)_

-   Has anyone else had the same problem?
-   Has a project come up with the solution
-   Is there a research paper about it?
-   Is there an article, video, podcast about it?
-   Is this even a good idea?
