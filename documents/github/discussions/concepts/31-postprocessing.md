            Large language models often give you what you need BUT not exactly what you need.

            Promptbook offers a set of useful ready-made functions to fix this problem, you can use them in Promptbooks or separately in any Typescript/Javascript project via [package @promptbook/utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@promptbook/utils).

            ## Example


            ```
            The greeting for your customer is "Hello Pavol".
            ```

            BUT you only need `Hello Pavol`.
