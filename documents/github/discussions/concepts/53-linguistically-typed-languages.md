            There are [no types in Promptbook](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/52), but we can do this thing quite differently from their point of view. Make a type system from a linguistic point of view.


            - Instead of primitives booleans, numbers, strings, symbols,... should be morphemes and lexemes.
            - Instead of objects, words, nouns, verbs, adjectives,...
            - Instead of complex structures, complex sentence types and structures or literary types like poem, essey,...



            But maybe this is a stupid or unworkable idea?
