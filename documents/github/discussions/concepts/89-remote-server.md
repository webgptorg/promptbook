            Remote server is a proxy server that uses its execution tools internally and exposes the executor interface externally.

            You can simply use `RemoteExecutionTools` on client-side javascript and connect to your remote server.
            This is useful to make all logic on browser side but not expose your API keys or no need to use customer's GPU.

            Remote server and client are exported in following packages:
            - [`@promptbook/remote-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@promptbook/remote-server)
            - [`@promptbook/remote-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@promptbook/remote-client)
