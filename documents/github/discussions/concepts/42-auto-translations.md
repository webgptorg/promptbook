Make an intelligent system for automatically translating promptbooks into any / selected (human) language according to parameters/prompt.

Generally it could work one of these ways:

1. There will be a master (for example English) and from this will be made translated variants. But you always have to edit the master.
2. You can edit any variant and this will automatically be reflected into all other variants.
3. Translation will be done during the execution phase, but there will be some JIT pre-translation (similar to https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/33).

(probably 3 is the best)
