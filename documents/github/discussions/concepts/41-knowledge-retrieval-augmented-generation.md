             Give [personas](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/22) access to external knowledge*.

             - RAG
             - Function call
             - Index search
             - Keyword search
             - Compression Search
             - LLM Search
             - external search
             - general tools like calculator
             - Web search with restrictions
             - Allows you to simply upload the document and automatically create the knowledgebase*.
             - Maybe create parameter `{context}` or  `{knowledge}`*


             ---

             * Think of the best word for this, "RAG" is a technical term, maybe "library", "knowledge", "wizard", "sage".

## 🔎 Existing solutions

_(Do some research / discussion)_

-   Has anyone else had the same problem?
-   Has a project come up with the solution
-   Is there a research paper about it?
-   Is there an article, video, podcast about it?
-   Is this even a good idea?
