<!--


In last century we have shifted through multiple fundamental changes we communicate with the machines, we have split ed please Shift multiple disting to generations which from our point of view each being  some fundamental new qualities


## Generation 0

1800-1945


This is actually pre- automatic competing era
Main motto of this generation is to use humans as a computer actually computer were not the machines but the profession

todo todo todo

## Generation 1

todo todo todo

Programming was actual re-wiring the vacuum tubes and later the transistors

Programing was effectively same thing as The were engineering

## Generation 2

todo todo todo

First symbolic languages you are mainly transferred through banjoles

Priest languages were very tightly coupled with The hardware

The most infamous language from this era is assembler or maybe we should say are assemblers because assembler is not one language but family of languages working on multiple hardware platforms



## Generation 3

todo todo todo

Symbolic languages that are not tightly coupled to hardware

Olomouc everyone works in the languages the most famous python and JavaScript

The first widely use language in this generation was probably Java

And also there were outliers which came much much earlier than other samples like basic Or covol which they came to be during the high of generation 2 were too much early in the scene

## Generation 4

todo todo todo

Languages that are decoupled from both hardware and the software platform.

This is first time in history where the computer program and literally genre is the same thing

Large language models act like new microprocessors for the next generation of languages.

The incredible growth in power of microprocessors and the Moore's Law have been the driving force behind the ever-more powerful languages, and it's been an amazing journey! Similarly, the large language models (like GP or Claude) are the next big thing in language technology, and they're set to transform the way we interact with computers.

## Conclusion

 The vast majority of applications are currently written in the highest level of abstraction.

Most websites and applications are not written in C or 2nd generation assembly language, but in Python, JavaScript, PHP, Java, SQL, HTML, Ruby,... 3rd generation languages


We are not at all removing the need for a 3rd generation language in the same way that, for example, Python does not remove the need to write some applications in C. However, we are saying that for most language applications, God is a better abstraction than languages or entire frameworks written with the 3rd generation paradigm.
