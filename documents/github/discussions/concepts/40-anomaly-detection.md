            This is a similar concept to [🧪 Expectations](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/30) and [👮 Agent Adversary Expectations](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/39), but more in depth how language models and vector spaces work.

            On each result or even parameter (despite its generated inside pipeline or its input parameter) based on [samples](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/43) or previous result detect anomalies and different texts as usual.

            Use combination of several methods:

            - Using agents to detect anomalies https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/39
            - Distance in the embedded vector space
            - Keyword search
            - Compression Search
            - Strange character search


            When an anomaly is detected, do one of the following

            - Just retry
            - Pause and check manually
            - Escalate to a better model

## 🔎 Existing solutions

_(Do some research / discussion)_

-   Has anyone else had the same problem?
-   Has a project come up with the solution
    -   https://www.evidentlyai.com/
    -   https://langtail.com/
-   Is there a research paper about it?
-   Is there an article, video, podcast about it?
-   Is this even a good idea?
