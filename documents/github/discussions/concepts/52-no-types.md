            There are no types in Promptbook, everything is just string / text. This simplifies a lot of things and reduces complexity.

            - There is no `null`, `undefined`, `NaN` etc, just empty string.
            - There are no numbers, integers, floats,... but numeric-like values work perfectly.
            - There are no booleans, but true / false values are a thing
            - There are no arrays, objects, tables and other data structures, you can use [formats](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/36) or [iterations](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/55) to look at strings with more structure.
            - There are no images, audio and video, but [maybe there should be](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/54).
            - There will probably be a different view of the type system [🌏 Linguistically typed languages](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/53)

## 🔎 Other existing solutions

_(Do some research / discussion)_

-   Has anyone else had the same problem?
-   Has a project come up with the solution
-   Is there a research paper about it?
-   Is there an article, video, podcast about it?
-   Is this even a good idea?
