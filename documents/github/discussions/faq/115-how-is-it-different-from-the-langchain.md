Langchain is primarily aimed at ML developers working in Python. This library is for developers working in javascript/typescript and creating applications for end users.

We are considering creating a bridge/converter between these two libraries.

Maybe include in the answer:

-   Langchain is the python library and JavaScript is on second place
-   Langchain primarily focused on making templates, not on combining templates into larger structures
-   at the language level it distinguishes between chat and completion, I need to mix the two into one template pipeline
-   for a non-programmer it's quite hard to work with such a thing and write templates - I would much prefer a system that allows non-technical people to write templates (of which there are many more on the market than free pythonists)
-   The focus of promptbooks is primarily on building user applications, not the data processing, training or autogpt.
