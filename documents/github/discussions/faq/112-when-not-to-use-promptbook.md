-   When you have already implemented single simple prompt and it works fine for your job
-   When [OpenAI Assistant (GPTs)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8673914-gpts-vs-assistants) is enough for you
-   When you need streaming _(this may be implemented in the future, [see discussion](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/102))_.
-   When you need to use something other than JavaScript or TypeScript _(other languages are on the way, [see the discussion](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/101))_
-   When your main focus is on something other than text - like images, audio, video, spreadsheets _(other media types may be added in the future, [see discussion](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/103))_
-   When you need to use recursion _([see the discussion](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/38))_
