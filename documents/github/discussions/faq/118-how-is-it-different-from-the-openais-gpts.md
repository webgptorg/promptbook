            GPTs are chat assistants that can be assigned to specific tasks and materials. But they are still chat assistants. Promptbooks are a way to orchestrate many more predefined tasks to have much tighter control over the process. Promptbooks are not a good technology for creating human-like chatbots, GPTs are not a good technology for creating outputs with specific requirements.
