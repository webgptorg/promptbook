-   When you want to **separate code from text prompts**
-   When you want to describe **complex prompt pipelines** and don't want to do it in the code
-   When you want to **orchestrate multiple prompts** together
-   When you want to **reuse** parts of prompts in multiple places
-   When you want to **version** your prompts and **test multiple versions**
-   When you want to **log** the execution of prompts and backtrace the issues
