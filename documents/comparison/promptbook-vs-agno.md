# Promptbook vs Agno

> ⚠ TODO: This document was written by AI Agent and needs to be proofread; Read is with a grain of salt

Agno (formerly known as Phidata) is a lightweight framework for building AI agents with memory, knowledge, and tools. It focuses on making agents "portable" and easy to integrate into any Python application, with a strong emphasis on structured output and tool calling.

While Agno is an excellent developer tool for Python-centric environments, Promptbook takes the concept of "portability" further by creating a dedicated, model-agnostic language (Book) and a federated server ecosystem (Promptbook Server) that allows agents to exist and interact across different languages and platforms.
