# Promptbook vs NotebookLM

> ⚠ TODO: This document was written by AI Agent and needs to be proofread; Read is with a grain of salt

NotebookLM is an AI-powered research and writing tool from Google. It is designed to help users synthesize information from multiple sources (documents, slides, websites) by creating a "source-grounded" AI that only answers based on the provided material. It is particularly known for its "Audio Overview" feature that creates podcast-like summaries of data.

While NotebookLM is an exceptional tool for personal research and "chatting with your data," it is a closed consumer product with limited extensibility and no API. Promptbook provides a similar "knowledge-grounded" experience through its `KNOWLEDGE` commitment but does so in an open, programmable, and highly customizable way. Promptbook is designed for building production-grade agents that can be integrated into professional software ecosystems, whereas NotebookLM is a standalone research workspace.
