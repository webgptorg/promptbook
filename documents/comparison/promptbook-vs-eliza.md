# Promptbook vs Eliza (Ai16z)

> ⚠ TODO: This document was written by AI Agent and needs to be proofread; Read is with a grain of salt


Eliza is a powerful multi-agent simulation framework developed by Ai16z. It is designed to create autonomous agents with distinct personalities, capable of interacting across various social platforms (like Twitter and Discord) and performing on-chain actions in the crypto ecosystem.

While Eliza excels at "personality-driven" social interaction and decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, Promptbook provides a more generalized, enterprise-ready framework for defining agents. Promptbook's Book language and commitment system offer a more structured approach to rule enforcement and knowledge management, making it suitable for a wider range of professional applications beyond social media and crypto.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Promptbook                                                                          | Eliza                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✔ **Book Language**: Declarative, high-level language for agent definitions.       | ✔ **Social Media Focus**: Excellent support for Twitter/Discord agents. |
| ✔ **Enterprise Focus**: Designed for professional tools and internal applications.  | ✔ **Crypto Integration**: Native support for Solana and other chains.  |
| ✔ **Adversary Verification**: Rigorous multi-agent rule enforcement.                | ✔ **Personality-Led**: Strong focus on character consistency and vibes.|
| ✔ **Federated Ecosystem**: Agents interact across servers and domains.               | ✔ **Active Community**: Vibrant ecosystem with plugins and extensions. |
| ✔ **Portable Definitions**: `.book` files are independent of the execution engine.  | ✘ **Framework Dependent**: Closely tied to the Eliza runtime.           |
| ✘ **Limited Social Platform Support**: Fewer pre-built social integrations.        | ✘ **Code-Centric**: Requires TypeScript knowledge for customization.   |
| 💡 **Agent "Commitment"**: Focuses on what the agent *must* and *must not* do.     | 💡 **Agent "Personality"**: Focuses on the *vibes* and social presence. |

**Best for:** Developers building reliable, portable, and rules-based AI agents for professional and enterprise environments with strict compliance requirements. | **Best for:** Creating autonomous, social-media-savvy agents with strong personalities for community engagement, crypto actions, and decentralized applications.
