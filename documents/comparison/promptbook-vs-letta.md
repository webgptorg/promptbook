# Promptbook vs Letta

> ⚠ TODO: This document was written by AI Agent and needs to be proofread; Read is with a grain of salt

Letta (the evolution of MemGPT) is a specialized framework for building AI agents with long-term memory. It uses a "Virtual Context Management" system (similar to an OS kernel) to allow agents to store and retrieve information beyond the standard LLM context window.

Letta is a powerful tool for building "stateless" agents that appear to have a deep memory of past interactions. Promptbook shares the goal of creating knowledgeable agents but approaches it through the `KNOWLEDGE` commitment (RAG and context management) and a focus on defining the agent's core character and rules in a portable language (Book).

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| ✔ **Commitment-Based Knowledge**: Native support for RAG via `KNOWLEDGE`.                                                                            | ✔ **Long-term Context**: Agents remember past interactions indefinitely.                                                                                              |
| ✔ **Language Agnostic**: Run agents anywhere with the Promptbook Engine.                                                                             | ✘ **Framework Specific**: Tied to the MemGPT/Letta ecosystem.                                                                                                         |
| ✘ **Basic Memory**: Simpler memory model compared to Letta's virtual context.                                                                        | ✘ **Code-First**: Agents are primarily built and managed via Python/JS.                                                                                               |
| 💡 **Agent Personality**: Strong focus on character traits and team dynamics.                                                                        | 💡 **Agent Memory**: Exceptional at managing "infinite" context.                                                                                                      |
| **Best for:** Building standardized, reliable, and rules-based AI agents that need to be portable and federated with strong personality enforcement. | **Best for:** Applications requiring agents with deep, long-term memory of past interactions, state management, and context that extends beyond typical token limits. |
