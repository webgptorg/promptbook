# Promptbook vs Digital Twins (Personal.ai & Delphi)

Digital Twin platforms like Personal.ai and Delphi are designed to create AI "clones" or "avatars" of real people. They focus on training models on an individual's specific data (emails, chats, videos) to mimic their voice, knowledge, and personality for scaling their time and presence.

While Promptbook also supports the creation of "Digital Twins" through its `PERSONA` and `KNOWLEDGE` commitments, it provides a more open, developer-centric framework. Promptbook allows for more granular control over behavior rules and multi-agent interaction, whereas Personal.ai and Delphi are primarily consumer-facing, hosted products focused on mimicry and monetization.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Promptbook                                                                          | Personal.ai / Delphi                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✔ **Open & Programmable**: Full control over agent logic via the Book language.     | ✘ **Closed Ecosystem**: Managed platforms with limited API access.     |
| ✔ **Federated & Portable**: Run your twin on any server or domain.                  | ✘ **Hosted Only**: Your data and twin are tied to their infrastructure. |
| ✔ **Strict Rule Enforcement**: `RULE` commitment ensures the twin stays on-brand.   | ✘ **Soft Mimicry**: Focuses on "vibe" matching over strict compliance. |
| ✔ **Multi-Agent Teams**: Your twin can collaborate with other specialized agents.    | ✘ **Solo Avatars**: Designed primarily as a single-agent "clone".      |
| ✔ **Model Agnostic**: Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models for your twin.        | ✘ **Model Optimized**: Often use proprietary or fine-tuned locked models. |
| 💡 **Agent Authority**: Focuses on a twin that can *act* reliably for you.          | 💡 **Agent Presence**: Focuses on a twin that can *be* you for others. |

**Best for:** Developers building self-hosted, highly-regulated Digital Twins that need to perform specific tasks reliably across multiple platforms. | **Best for:** Creators and public figures looking for a quick, hosted solution to create a conversational avatar for fan engagement or knowledge sharing.
