# Promptbook vs ChatGPT

> ⚠ TODO: This document was written by AI Agent and needs to be proofread; Read is with a grain of salt

ChatGPT is a general-purpose conversational AI developed by OpenAI, designed to assist users across a wide range of topics through natural language interactions. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to generate human-like responses based on the input it receives.

While ChatGPT is highly capable, it primarily functions as a raw model interface or a simple chatbot. It lacks a structured way to define complex agent personalities, enforceable rules, and deeply integrated knowledge bases that are portable and model-agnostic. In the enterprise context, ChatGPT often suffers from "jailbreaking" vulnerabilities where instructions are bypassed, a problem Promptbook solves through **Adversary Enforcement**.
