# Promptbook vs ChatGPT

ChatGPT is general-purpose conversational AI developed by OpenAI, designed to assist users across a wide range of topics through natural language interactions. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to generate human-like responses based on the input it receives.

It has no specific persona, behavior rules, or specialized knowledge sources defined by the user. Its responses are generated based on a vast dataset it was trained on, without any user-defined commitments or capabilities.
