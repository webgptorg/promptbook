# Promptbook vs OpenAI GPTs assistants

> ⚠ TODO: This document was written by AI Agent and needs to be proofread; Read is with a grain of salt

ChatGPT-Assistance (referring to OpenAI's Assistant API and Custom GPTs) allows users to build custom versions of ChatGPT that combine instructions, extra knowledge, and any combination of skills (tools). It is designed for developers and power users who want to create specialized AI experiences within the OpenAI ecosystem.

While ChatGPT-Assistance provides more control than the standard chat interface, it remains a "walled garden" heavily dependent on OpenAI's proprietary infrastructure. It lacks the explicit, portable **Commitment** system that Promptbook uses to ensure agent reliability and character consistency across different model providers and environments. Furthermore, ChatGPT-Assistance often struggles with "forgetting" instructions in long threads, a problem Promptbook mitigates through specialized **Adversary Verification** and structured context management.
